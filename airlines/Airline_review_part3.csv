21000,TUI Airways,9,"""service as a whole was very good""",18th July 2018,True," 
Flight to Cancun, cabin premium. Evening check in of baggage at LGW is helpful if staying overnight at the airport and was easily done. As part of their premium package they include premium security passes and lounge access, security was quick, the No 1 traveller lounge was busy but fine for quick snack. The aircraft was only 4 months old so was clean and well presented. Welcome drinks offered shortly after priority boarding and Rituals amenity pack handed out. On time departure. The inflight service as a whole was very good, bar service after take off and menu choices taken crew very attentive with a real can do attitude. The first meal was nicely presented with main course brought out separately after started finished. Good inflight movies etc and regular bar services during flight for those that wanted it. A tasty afternoon tea was served prior to landing with sandwiches, Victoria sponge cake and scone/roddas clotted cream. The first officer made announcements during the flight which being both a day and leisure flight was a nice touch. Baggage off belt quickly. A very good flight. I have to conclude by saying that holding a high tier status with our flag carrier, they were the alternative consideration. However, having flown with them regularly, they would not have emulated the service TUI provided in their premium economy cabin and a 20 year old 777 would have struggled to compete with the Dreamliner!",Boeing 787-9,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,London Gatwick to Cancun,July 2018,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,5.0,yes
21001,TUI Airways,3,"""farce at the bag drop""",30th June 2018,False," Manchester to Palma. Arrived 3 hours before our morning flight from Manchester to Palma. Done everything we were asked to do, had our printed boarding cards so all that was left was to drop off our luggage. When we arrived at terminal 2 we were greeted by a queue almost the full length of the terminal which we were told to join. After about 30 minutes we got to the zig zag line so thought that we would soon be through, only to find that the queue extended down the tunnel towards terminal 3 for some 200 metres, doubled back then you got to the zig zag queue. After almost 3 hours with our flight time approaching we got to the root of the problem. Only 3 tui staff supervising travellers to check in their luggage using the installed self serve machines. We managed to check most of our luggage in, but the machine wouldnt accept one of them. We asked for assistance 3 times and waited but got no assistance for over half an hour. We then had the security checks to contend with, which is another story. We eventually made the flight but only because all TUI flights had to be delayed due to the farce at the bag drop.

21002,TUI Airways,8,"""helpful and very friendly""",30th May 2018,True,"  First time flying TUI long haul, this time from Manchester to Orlando Sanford. Very impressed on both legs. Staff genuinely helpful and very friendly. Flights left bang on time. Two rounds of free drinks 0 food not bad for economy. Afternoon Tea great. On return leg we had a row to ourselves.

21003,TUI Airways,1,"""Check-in chaotic and disorganised""",20th May 2018,True,"  Birmingham to Malaga. Check-in for the flight was extremely chaotic and disorganised. Queuing barriers were arranged near escalators causing unnecessary congestion and confusion amongst passengers. Airline staff were no where to be seen to offer assistance and guidance to passengers. Boarding seemed to go smoothly however this was probably because the Cabin Crew were not asking to see boarding passes. My seat was uncomfortable and unsupportive due to the padding being worn out. Food and drinks were very expensive (even at airline prices) so would recommend you buy in the airport before the flight. The in charge crew member was putting on some silly voice whilst making announcements which literally made me cringe and squirm in my seat. My seat area and tray table were filthy and the aircraft looked as though it had not been cleaned properly in a while e.g. large clumps of dust around air vents etc. Some of my travelling party are former cabin crew and spotted numerous things that the crew were not doing e.g. not checking boarding passes? How do you know who is getting on the plane. Noticed a crew member not allowing passengers to put their bags in emergency equipment compartments however then noticed the same crew member shoving her own shoes, coat and toiletries bags in the same area? Crew in general seemed very complacent when going about their duties.",Boeing 757,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Birmingham to Malaga,May 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,no
21004,TUI Airways,6,"""operated by Sunwing""",18th May 2018,True,"  Norwich to Rhodes. TUI flight in fact operated by Canadian carrier Sunwing. Plane clean and tidy with seats that were more than adequate for the 4hr flight to Rhodes. Staff friendly enough, and stewardesses were British, but flight crew Canadian. Only two gripes, firstly, why do the airline try to get you to check in on line when, upon arriving at both departure airports, you are made to stand in a long queue with those who'd not checked in online? Complete waste of my time. And secondly (and TUI are by no means the only offenders) why did they have no food for purchase on the return leg? It is not rocket science to calculate that on a long-ish flight like that that passengers will want something to eat in both directions, so for goodness sake order enough from the caterers for BOTH legs of the flight. From TUI's point of view it makes sense as they missed out on making a fat profit on sandwiches etc they could have sold ! Otherwise, a decent product in the leisure market.",Boeing 737-800,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Norwich to Rhodes,May 2018,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,,,4.0,yes
21005,TUI Airways,1,"""told they had now closed the flight""",27th April 2018,True,"  Gatwick to Las Palmas.  The customer experience made Ryanair look like a 5 star airline. Recently tried to fly with TUI to take my partner on holiday and get engaged. Unable to check in online for an unknown reason. Arrived at the airport check in area later than planned due to traffic, but on time according to the terms and conditions on the ticket. I was concerned about the length of the queue so sought assistance from a member of staff in Tui branding at the self check in desks, explained the situation and she checked flight times etc and told me we had plenty of time and to queue. After queuing I was told they had now closed the flight (while we were queuing) and we couldn’t board. I then had to run around the airport to find another flight. TUI’s customer services teams response, computer says no issues (effectively we can’t be bothered to investigate because we don’t want to have to compensate you) and the airport staff don’t work for us so we do my care (despite then wearing our branding). We flew with Tui on the return flight so I can review the flight experience which was nothing special. ",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Gatwick to Las Palmas,April 2018,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
21006,TUI Airways,1,"""facilities and food were atrocious""",14th March 2018,True," Flew London Gatwick to Cancun. TUI should stick to short haul - they obviously have no experience of managing long haul. Apart from messing up our extra legroom seats, we then had to pay to 'downgrade' to get seats together. This was an 8-10 hour flight, but the facilities and food were atrocious - the cheapest, disposable, plastic earphones were totally unsuited to listening to a film - we both gave up. The quality of food served was on a par with airline food 30 year's ago - plastic chicken served going out and same on return. There are absolutely no frills whatsoever despite high prices. There is no comparison with recognised long haul carriers such as Virgin, Emirates, BA etc. This is short haul behaviour at long haul costs, with the added issue of paying to sit together (a Ryanair Scam).

21007,TUI Airways,8,"""Cabin crew were friendly""",16th February 2018,True," Excellent flight with TUI on the Dreamliner between London Gatwick and Barbados. Check-in was a breeze and queue not very long. Boarding was done by rows, which seemed to help with congestion. Seats were leater, which were ok for the flight duration, seat back screen clear and had the latest films and entertainment. Cabin crew were friendly and always on hand to get a new drink or answer any questions. Two hot meals provided on this 8 hours flight, one large and one small, which was nearly the same as what we received with BA on a 13 hours flight! Impressive! Captains were great and very informative, it was also nice having them come on the PA mid-way during the flight to provide an update on the conditions and how we were progressing, which doesn't happen that often any more on these flights. I would have no hesitation in flying TUI again.",Boeing 787-8,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London Gatwick to Barbados,February 2018,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,yes
21008,TUI Airways,1,"""excellence of her performance""",31st January 2018,True,  Stansted to Las Palmas. On January 29th I sustained an injury to my leg 5 minutes before boarding the aircraft caused by a rack of 3 wheelchairs striking my shin heavily as it was pushed away from the aircraft door along the narrow passageway by a Stansted employee. I was seated in an opposing wheelchair using assistance provided by the airport. On impact which caused me to cry out with pain and and the staff did nothing and continued on her way. On entering the cabin with great difficulty the Cabin Manager assessed the situation and seated me in the first available seat and applied a pack of ice to the injury. She carried out first aid throughout the flight raising my leg and applying ice and compression also as she could see I was somewhat shocked. Her care was exemplary and greatly reduced the bruising and severity of the injury. I didn’t secure her surname but I wish you to note the excellence of her performance. Consequently I have minimal swelling and bruising and discomfort so am able to continue my holiday.

21009,TUI Airways,9,"""a really good airline""",29th January 2018,True," Departure Airport - Firstly, an overview of the airport. We were checked in for our flight so quickly as we were called to an empty lane at CMF (their queues work differently there!). The staff were chatty and friendly. You are advised to go through security once called as there is not much on the other side. The queue was a bit long but we got moving within half an hour. After boarding, we had 20 minutes to relax until pushback. THE FLIGHT took off, and it was only five minutes late - rare that a TUI flight I go on is on time. The cabin service soon followed, but the rear trolley had to return to the galley as we had a lot of turbulence for the first half an hour. We descended and that turbulence went. The back trolley was back in service and we ordered our food. Unfortunately, they only had a bacon baguette or a ham and cheese toastie - in small numbers. Luckily, we were able to get two bacon baguettes. They were yummy, but a bit expensive. After that, there were final checks for the descent into Manchester. We were served well by the crew. Arrival Airport - We landed nice and punctual, but a little bottleneck happened as it said 'All bags will be delivered before 14.50'. Well, a little lie there as I only had one of my three bags by 14.50! The belt stopped and started again and we finally got all our bags around half an hour later. All in all, a really good airline, would fly again, but side note: they removed the seatback pockets and made this little storage area behind the tray table (when you see the photo below, you'll understand what I mean), where they put all the magazines and safety card.",Boeing 757-200,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Chambery (CMF) to Manchester (MAN),January 2018,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,,,4.0,yes
21010,TUI Airways,3,"""premium economy was comfortable""",18th December 2017,True,  Barbados to Birmingham via Gatwick. Absolute chaos in both Barbados airport and onboard plane. In the airport terminal the flight was displayed as going to Bournemouth with the BHX flight number. We were advised the plane was taking some passengers for Gatwick due to operational reasons once on board. The staff on board did not appear to know how many passengers and two were also in accounted for. Hence nearly 3 hour delay. The accommodation in premium economy was comfortable and food and drink was good. The pilot did warn us to expect turbulence due to weather conditions. We needed to fasten our seatbelts for a good proportion of the journey. The Boeing 787 is comfortable with lots of overhead storage space but not enough toilets. When the cabin crew were advised -prepare for landing we appeared to be circling round for some time when the captain announced we were unable to land due to snow and closure of BHX. He needed to communicate regarding where was safe to land. We eventually landed at LGW some 3hours after original ETA. I appreciate we landed safely and of course am grateful for this. However upon landing we had to collect luggage clear customs and were given a £5 refreshment voucher which we barely had time to use before being herded on to coaches back to BHX. We left between 08:30 and 09:00. Conditions on road were extremely hazardous in snow. The journey took 10 hours and we eventually arrived back at BHX some 14 hours after original estimated time of arrival. As a result I lost my paid for taxi and had to stay in a hotel overnight prior to completing my journey home. Had chaos not ensued at the beginning of our journey we may have landed on time prior to closure of BHX,Boeing 787,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Barbados to Birmingham via Gatwick,December 2017,3.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,no

Slight delay on the outbound flight due to late arrival of the plane at Brussels Airport but final arrival in Fuerteventura was on time. Return flight had a delay of a bit less then 2hrs due to technical problems with the first foreseen plane. We had the nice Boeing Sky Interior on the return plane so that was a plus! In general clean planes and pleasant (young) cabin crew on both flights. Meals and drinks for purchase but nice selections though. We booked and paid for emergency exit seats so that we would have extra legroom, highly recommendable on such longer flights imho!

21013,TUIfly,1,"""We have your money, and what can you do?""",26th July 2022,True," I have purchased tickets to fly from Amsterdam to Ibiza. TUI officially announced in media that no flights will be cancelled, everything looked good until the last moment, when I suddenly got an email that my flight got moved to Liege, different country, 270km away. The flight was schedule on 6.20 morning Saturday so because I worked on Friday evening and there is totally no night transportation between Amsterdam and Liege, there was no way for me to get to Liege. I have called TUI and a very polite lady told me, that indeed there is no other way but to cancel the tickets and she can do it for me. I asked her, to be sure if the funds will be transferred back to my account, she confirmed (I got credit note and cancellation bill) and that’s the moment when the show begins. The email on their website doesn’t work, when after an hour waiting you finally get someone on the phone, they send you to chat, after days of waiting for answer on messenger the tell you to call (with a smiley), on twitter they say that: “it is busy and I probably received the money because system says: 0€” so basically their approach is: ""We have your money, and what can you do?""",,Business,Premium Economy,Amsterdam to Ibiza,July 2022,1.0,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,no

I’ve traveled with a lot of airline companies that have an excellent customer service and the TUI fly service was the worst. My flight got delayed without telling us a reason and I lost my two connection flights to the other destinations. I went to their customer service department in Brussels and the ladies didn’t help me at all, didn’t advise me what should I do and they were laughing at me. Their customer service in Miami told me that for sure my lost flight will be rescheduled in Belgium and nothing happened. They don’t know their own policy at all. I was so frustrated that I bought extra ticket for my connection flights and I had zero help from their department. They told me to go to an agency near them to book a new ticket which was 500€.

Boarding was good as well as the onboard experience. Two major air carrier from AMS-CUR are KLM and TUI. Despite TUI fly their B787, however Deluxe class non-flatbed seats are unbeatable against KLM flatbed.

21020,TUIfly,5,"""seats were so horrendous""",18th December 2019,True,"  On December 15th me and my partner flew from Curacao to Amsterdam, with a stop at Aruba, on a Boeing 767-300ER of TUIfly Netherlands. Check-in was quick, but due to a late arrival of the aircraft boarding started late. Passengers to Amsterdam had to board first, while the passengers from Amsterdam to Aruba were asked to board second and fill up the remaining unassigned seats. The flight to Aruba was very quick (only 20 minutes) and no serviced was provided due to the short flight time. At Aruba the passengers to Amsterdam were asked to remain seated while the aircraft was prepared for its last leg to Amsterdam. After 90 minutes on the ground we departed slightly later then planned to Amsterdam. The seats were extremely narrow (this 767 was equipped with a 2-4-2 configuration, instead of the designed 2-3-2 configuration). Legroom was good, because we booked comfort class (a pitch of 33 inch), but the seats weren’t equipped with head rests. The interior looked also very dated due to the old overhead bins. The entertainment system was fine with a limited but good selection of movies and television series. After take-off dinner was served (chicken with onion sauce, which was not very good) with a non-alcoholic drink service, after which coffee or tea were served. The lights were dimmed (it was a night flight) and two hours before arrival breakfast was served (a croissant with a yoghurt and a drink).

Boarding on the other hand was very smooth and efficient. I prebooked Economy comfort (34 inch leg space), seat 12A, which was quite comfortable. The seat was quite narrow though. The seat was equipped with an PTV with a pretty small selection of movies. A free headset and pillow were distributed. After take off the crew came around with a drink service (alcohol was charged), follow by a hot (small) meal with a drink and coffee or tea. During the flight it was possible to order paid snacks or drinks, but there were also two complementary drink rounds.

On the day of departure, our flight from Brussels to Montego Bay got canceled because of some technical issues with the airplane. We were really upset because we were supposed to leave for our honeymoon, so all our anger was directed towards TUI. They explained to us what has happened and that we shall leave the next day, so they provided accommodation, meals and transfers. Everything was very well organized and the staff was very helpful. After coming back from our honeymoon, we also filed a complaint for the delay resulting in us missing one night in Jamaica, and the airline compensated us, no questions asked, according to the EU regulations. Now you may say that TUIFly caused us a lot of inconveniences and that may be true. But technical problems with an airplane can happen now and then. It is the way the airline handled the situation after that: great accommodation (Crowne Plaza Brussels), buffet dinner (very good quality), prompt transfers back to the airport, and proper compensation according to EU regulations for delayed/canceled flights. I think that every time we fly there is a chance of unforeseeable delay / cancellation, and it is the way customers are treated that makes the difference.

The air-con was on to the max, turning the plane into a fridge, and when we asked for a blanket we were charged £6 which is extortionate for a product that should be provided for free - and is by many competitor airlines, namely BA.

21029,TUIfly,1,"""delayed again and again""",1st January 2018,True,"  Cancun to Amsterdam. I was scheduled to fly on 17th December, arrived to the airport and went through the check-in and all the security checks. After that, we (as for all the passengers) were waiting to board, which had seemed to start any minute. But it was being delayed every ten minutes for another ten minutes until there was a 4 hour delay at which point the pilots came to inform us there were some issues with the airplane's computer, which they were trying to fix, but they would reboot the computer's system and we'd be boarding in an hour. Another hour passed and the pilots came, saying at 2 A.M. (5 hours after the scheduled time of takeoff) that they weren't able to fix the problem and that all the passengers are gonna be accommodated in a five-star hotel for the night (after we get our visas back and go again through immigration) and that we would be informed what the next step is in the morning. I asked if I wasnt going to go to the hotel, if I could get the money instead, so I can buy food and water in the airport, they said no. Next morning I was waiting for any kind of information about the new flight. There was none in the airport and none on my email or my cellphone. Meanwhile my girlfriend arrived, we said our goodbyes and she left before I had at least some minor information about my flight, although the international departure board was all the time showing that the check-in for my flight was about to begin in 40 minutes. But 40 minutes turned out to be the whole day and at about 5 P.M. the check-in opened for my flight. I was lucky they hadn't changed the terminal because I wouldn't have found out. OK, I went through the check-in again, through security checks again and the flight was delayed again and again and again, unsure to even take-off that night. In the end we departed from a different gate and 25 hours later but we departed. I am trying to make a complaint to get compensation for the delayed flight. There is an official complaint app at the airline's website. It doesn't work. So I wrote an email. They answered that I have to complain at the website's official complain program. I sent another email, saying that for whatever reason I cannot get inside that program. I sent them the official  complaint form and all the information they needed to know. Their answer after that was that my email was empty and I have to write a new one. It takes 2 days for them to answer every time. So I wrote a new one.

I was supposed to fly with my infant daughter and my mother a 3 hour direct trip from Chania to Brussels on 30 June. Two weeks before the flight we received a message that our flight would take 6 hours due to a stopover in Kos Island. I called the airline and asked what it was about - they said no worries, a small stopover, you will not need to disembark. Ok, suboptimal but acceptable til now. On the day of the flight, we check in normally, and when we look to take our seats, they were occupied. I tell the attendants that I must sit with my infant daughter and mother, and they just say to randomly take seats because the plane is totally unoccupied. Ok. We sit. I then ask if we have to switch to our assigned seats on the Kos stopover, because it will be extremely difficult for me to carry the baby, all the baby bags, and my own stuff, wake the baby up (she sleeps at takeoff), and move. They say we'll do our best for you to keep your seats. At Kos we are suddenly announced to disembark because they have to fuel up and the policy is no passengers during fueling (although all the crew remained on board).  What a mess. Talked to other discontent passengers, many had huge delays when flying into Chania in the first place (ex. flight scheduled for 6 am finally takes off at 8 am). Then get back on the plane to the assigned seats, try to calm the baby down, etc. Of couse needless to say nobody helped with the baby. I'm glad we arrived safe and that our luggage was not lost.

Unfortunately there seems to be little padding in the seat cushion.. The food was pretty gross looking, but was edible. The staff offered lots of water to passengers, which was great, but only came around twice with other beverages. I was not expecting there to be any entertainment onboard, thus I was very happy to find that there were a few movies and TV shows available. My personal TV was actually broken, but since the seat next to me was empty, I was able to use that one instead. Overall, the staff were nice, and the plane seemed relatively clean.

The flight was booked via a travel agency with a baggage allowance of 20kg and onboard service included. When booking TUIfly it is very important to see whats included in your flight as many differences excist (from 15kg to 20kg for checked bags, free snack and drink on board or for extra charges). Online check-in was already possible 30 days in advance and easy. The computer is deciding about your seats, filling the plane from the back to the front. So if you don't like your assigned seats just wait a while and try to check-in again, because a seatchange will cost you EUR13 per person and segment. For dropping of bags in the morning two counters were open and a long queue in front of them. It took around 40 mins to line up. Aircraft was parked on a remote stand. Departure was delayed by 15-20 mins without any Information given on board (2 passengers came late). Later on routing and current landing time were given frequently. During the service, flight attendants ask you if you have snack and drink included (printed on a separate boarding card) or you like to purchase anything from the café menu in your seatpocket (if there). We had a choice between a bun with cheese or ham which was ok but nothing special and could choose between coffee, tea or a softdrink. Good thing: softdrinks are handed over in a 0,5 liter bottle with a cup. Duty free shopping followed. Crew average, neither friendly or unfriendly. Nothing special to remember. As the plane was ex Sunexpress the seats looked different and after nearly 3 hours of flight I felt quite cramped and it was hard to move. No entertainment or airshow was shown, only the safety video on cabin screens.

21064,TUIfly,2,TUIfly customer review,13th January 2009,False,"Berlin Tegel - Las Palmas return. Horrid airline both compared with other typical tourist ""charter"" airlines and other budget airlines like Easyjet or Germanwings. Tuifly is stuck somewhere in the middle just worse. Checked in online and printed our boarding passes at home only to find out that the ""Fast bag drop"" line at TXL was full of people who obviously hadn't done the online checkin. Upon asking one of the unfriendly staff members I was told that the bag drop counter ""does not work as everything is drowning here in Tegel"". How about sending passengers without a printed boarding pass to one of the other counters to make it work? Many others complained about that and started fights with the extremely unable staff members strangely the bag drop worked perfectly fine on the way back in Las Palmas. Had two hour delay on the outbound flight everybody was just waiting around in the terminal and no information was given as to the reasons for the delay no staff visible at the gates. Flight itself was uneventful plane ten years old but maintained poorly. Staff onboard arrogant and alcohol had to be paid. Arrived late in Las Palmas and had to wait for a further hour at the luggage belt for no reason again no staff around. Our transfer driver told us later that TUIfly is known for paying the least of all airlines hence their luggage will be offloaded last. He told us that he had left an hour late as he already knew we would be late. Same thing on the return more than an hour delay. Return aircraft was really dodgy an old 737-300 which looked as if it was about to fall apart any time. Interior worn toilets and seats not cleaned between flights. Also obviously no re-stocking since leaving Germany on the outbound to the Canaries almost all beverages were sold out. It's anyone's guess how maintenance procedures might look like at an airline that otherwise does everything it can so save a buck. Never again!",,,,,,,,,,,,,no
21065,TUIfly,4,TUIfly customer review,23rd November 2008,False,MAN-CGN-MAN with TuiFly this past week - could teach EasyJet and Ryanair a thing or two. Good value (130 Euros return) speedy friendly check-in seat pre-selection at no additional cost 20kg of checked bags at no additional cost. Spotless 737 with reasonably priced on-board catering. Decent seats with fair leg-room. Flight crew efficient and smiling. A breath of fresh-air after some of the snarling horrors I have encountered on other LCCs. At the moment they only serve MAN and NCL in the UK from a handful of German airports (Cologne-Bonn Stuttgart and Hannover) but there are some really interesting onward destinations (such as Tenerife for which I just forked out £400 for an EasyJet flight-from-hell).,,,,,,,,,,,,,no

21073,TUIfly,3,TUIfly customer review,29th April 2008,False,Cologne-Hamburg return Boeing 737-800 and 737-700. This airline is a LCC so no free drinks or food. For 45 minute leg this is fine. Both flights late by around 15 minutes. Seat reservation via online booking cost 9 Euro per leg. Booked seat 1C on both legs an no problem with check in.

On the way back they decided to land in Tenerife and pick up more passengers so 4 hours became 6! Watch out when booking - you pay for anything and everything - so much so that the only people who get coffee are those that have paid for breakfast. When I asked if I could buy a coffee was told No!,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
21075,TUIfly,1,TUIfly customer review,10th March 2008,False,I booked two Tuifly flights in late August for November: DUS-KLU and CGN-INN. The departure times were changed for both flights in advance (3 hours earlier/ 6 hours later). Web check-in didn't work properly for one of the flights so that had to contact the desk at the airport. The staff was very unfriendly and not willed to print a real boarding pass. When I entered the security area a delay for an unknown reason was announced. In the end we were allowed to board the plane 3 hours later (no vouchers or anything else were handed out to the passengers). The seat pitch was miserable and the cabin was dirty - crew was unfriendly. All in all I can only say that I had a horrible feeling when I was on board a Tuifly plane.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no

Too shallow, too hard, didn't recline nearly enough (barely a few centimeters). By the time we arrived my butt had ceased to exist. Whatever happened to nice, soft airline seats where you could sleep? The ground staff at Helsinki airport was decidedly pedantic and unpleasant. At Lanzarote however the staff was quite cheerful and helpful. Timeliness was good on the departure, but on the return trip we were 1 hour delayed with no explanation nor apology.

We were told by a frequent passenger of the airline that this is common. To make things worse, this is the first time I've seen torn upholstery on the plane: it was filthy and scruffy. 2nd flight was only mildly delayed.

Despite a scheduled one hour stop in Rome and short flight, a modest breakfast was served with a croissant and small yougurt. Surprised they severed anything.

I was scheduled for another flight 3 hours later, but each time the boarding time approached, the flight was rescheduled even more. The Tunisair staff was extremely impolite and disrespectful: they would turn away from me in the middle of a sentence, not inform me properly on the actual situation and not even try to find solutions in my interest. Altogether I had a delay of 10 hours. The food and water that was provided during this delay were ridiculous. Once arrived in Paris, my two bags were missing.

My passport was held by transit officers there and I was not allowed to leave the transit room at all. They lost my baggage tag and my boarding pass. I asked for a hotel room to stay the night and they just shout at you and don't reply.

Very very bad. It was like a nightmare. They have no one to complain to, no customer service, no email replies, no phone replies, simply nothing! Next day I arrived to Barcelona to find out that my luggage was missing.

On this flight there were two of us who were disabled and had booked for assistance. When we got to Tunis no one knew (or so they said) that we needed assistance. They had stairs for passengers to use we were unable to use stairs. The Cabin crew just shrugged their shoulders and we waited over an hour on the plane before a clapped out host arrived. Then when we got to the building they only had one wheel chair and the poor porter had to go hunting for another chair.

I have had flights delayed between 2 to 8 hours and have come to expect delays all the time. It’s painful and frustrating each time. I don’t understand how this airline remains in business with such poor punctuality record and customer service. Sadly, there’s very little competition thus it continues to trap customers.

Allowing anyone into the cockpit is a serious security breach but unfortunately the norm at this state airline - you can imagine in case of an evacuation the crew would mainly care out their relatives. Also the AC didn't work, food was lousy and the crew generally crude but the main reason I won't be using them is the security breach. Tunisair is a loss-making state carrier controlled by labour unions which oppose reforms such as scrapping of free tickets for employees - other airlines offer similar benefits but I doubt they allow kids to take off in the cockpit. Also the captain upgraded passengers to business class after takeoff, probably his relatives or friends so why would anyone pay business class ?",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Dakar to Tunis,March 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
21094,Tunisair,1,"""she never responded""",26th March 2018,True," Our first flight from CAI to TUN (# 814) on Aug 31, 2017 was delayed with initially no delay notification. We were delayed for this flight in the airport for over 4 hours with no food. Once on board the plane, we did not get the vegetarian meal that we requested when booking our tickets. Upon arrival in Tunis a representative told us that our meals, a hotel and transportation to and from the hotel would be provided to us free of charge. We were denied our request for a dinner voucher (after not having eaten all day), shops were closed so we didn't eat dinner. We talked with a representative who confirmed in the computer that we had selected the vegetarian meal option when we reserved our flight but somehow the request had not gotten through the system and he was unable to correct this for our next flight because of late notice to the caterers. So we went on another flight without food. Our flight from TUN to MAD on Sep 1 was again delayed and initially, we were not told how long we would have to wait. During our long wait in Tunis airport, we were given a single meal voucher. The meal that was provided didn't have anything we could eat and it took numerous difficult conversations, and over an hour, and requests from multiple people to get something that we could eat, and only then were we given a very small serving of vegetables, far less food than the equivalent standard meal. The flight 606 from TUN to MAD was delayed, again, past the rescheduled time. No new vouchers or meals were provided. Our flight didn't end up departing until at least 5 hours after the original departure time. We have a photo of the flight announcement board showing this. On the plane, again, the vegetarian meal we had ordered was not provided. Our plan was to be picked up by our friends who drove 3 hours from Portugal but since the flight was so delayed so long, and we were not given information about the delay, even though we asked, that we arrived Madrid past midnight, they had to pay for a hotel to sleep for the night. We were told to wait by the customer desk at Tunisair's counter in the airport, and we waited there for an hour and no one showed up. We had to pay for a taxi into the city, struggled to find something we could eat (having eaten so little in the past days) and pay for a hotel to stay that night. We told our experience to a Tunisair representative in Madrid who said that she would take care of it if we emailed her our experience. We did so, and she never responded. We also emailed several other places in the organization and no one ever responded. We filed a complaint report on one of our return flights, which no one ever responded to as well. In January, I continued to make calls to speak with a person on the phone. I spent hours on different lines, being referred from one place to another with every staffer I spoke to ""not having the authority"" to do anything about it, nor able to transfer me to someone in their department who could. On January 19th I finally found an agent in your office in Montreal who said that they would be able to resolve the situation, and would respond soon. No one got back to me until I had to reach out again on Feb 26th asking about the status of the claim, and only then did the agent ask me for my home address.

In all other ways this was a truly dismal experience. Check-in was surly to say the least and, given how empty the plane was, very slow. Tunis airport is in serious need of some TLC. It feels cramped and hot and there are remarkably few areas to sit down airside. Onboard the seats were filthy, old and disgusting. Perhaps once the blue leather might have seemed like a good idea, but not any more. The seatback table was filthy. The food, when it came, was delivered with the same surly disinterest as the rest of the service. And it was disgusting. The aircraft was kept at an uncomfortably high temperature. But most shocking was the incapacity of the crew to contain the passengers. On departure there were children in the aisles, window shades down and seats reclined. the moment we landed people were pulling things out of the overhead bins without any intervention from the crew. Baggage took ages to arrive and Tunisair operates into T4 at LHR which meant a twenty minute wait to cross the runway on the way in and a long wait to get a train back to the central area.

The website had issues being available at some hours of the day during that period (the TU server did not respond). Once accessed though, the procedure was fast and simple.

Left the lounge early to ensure I go through security and immigration procedures on time before boarding. Boarding was handled by bus (most times for TU out of FRA). Boarding was smooth, although no announcements were made to ensure boarding by zones / classes and for families with kids, rather a general announcement was made for a general boarding, of a full flight. Aircraft was a A319. Business class configuration was 2-2 with larger and seemingly more comfortable seats than economy class seats. It is a plus for this type of leg. LH and other TU flights on this leg offer a 3-3 regular economy class configurations with a blocked seat in the middle. The aircraft looked tired, dirty floors and dirty walls and panels. There is a PTV in the arm rest, which I did not try, so I am not sure if it worked. Now that catering is back to Tunisair, the meal service was good for this type of flight, with a salad (smoked salmon, mushroom), a hot offering with a selection of a beef or a seafood dish. I chose the seafood option, which was quite tasty and nice. Meal service was accompanied with a beverage service. Champagne, wines were offered. TU serves Piper Heidsieck Rosé at this time of the day. A great choice. Although the crew member was nice throughout the meal service (there was only one crew member working the Business class section of 12 passengers), she seemed to be a bit overwhelmed, forgetting requests for beverage re-fills etc. There was a single beverage service throughout the meal, until coffee. Not even another offering of water. The meal service was overall good considering the length of the flight. Overall the crew members were nice, smiling and very helpful. What ever imperfection I noted, I would attribute to a lack of training and the absence of clear direction as to how to handle a meal service. This is truly a flaw in the quality system of the airline and lack of training. Not blaming crew members as individuals. All announcements were made in Arabic and German. Nothing in English, including the safety announcements and demonstration. English should be added. Another illustration of breakdown in SOPs and lack of quality systems. This flight was overall pleasant. Tunisair has potential. Attention to cleanliness and training for inflight service is needed.",A319,Business,Business Class,FRA to TUN,July 2016,4.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,,,4.0,yes

After boarding we had a technical issue and the crew announced first that we would be leaving in few minutes and then in 10 minutes. We waited for 1hr 20 min in the aircraft waiting.

The meal service started about 15 minutes after take off, there was one option, Ham with green beans with a bread roll. There was a bar service followed by hot drinks.

A319 on FRA-TUN had business class seats , the crew was always on hand and the lounge in FRA was comfortable and a good choice of food and drinks. During the flight a selection of beverages was available free of charge and the crew offered additional drinks several times. The snack was a little small for the business class price, only a sandwich and a piece of cake was served. The flight back was good also, but there were no business class seats - just economy class seating with free middle seat. The lounge in Tunis is not the most comfortable but it does its job. The crew was friendly. Only minus point here: no food due to problems at Tunis airport (we were informed at the lounge so we had some snacks there).

It was the first and will be the last time I would fly anywhere with this airline. Check in for both flights met with miserable uncommunicative staff who clearly don't want to be at work ancient filthy aircraft you start having serious thoughts about safety surly lazy cabin crew food offerings look so inedible you don't bother opening the plastic packaging 3.5 hour delay on return flight from Tunis to London no updates or explanations just wait wait wait at the gate in the grimy surroundings that appear to be the norm for Tunisair.

21112,Tunisair,2,Tunisair customer review,19th April 2015,False,This is not my first review on Tunis Air but since the closure of the London-Tunis flight on BA this is the only scheduled direct service from the UK right now. Departed on the TU790 on the 06th April. The flight was over 2 hours late arriving into London on the inbound so did not depart until some time after the STD. Outbound aircraft (TS-IMH) was very old (1994) and extremely dirty inside. The cabin crew were not very happy and showed this in the service or lack of during the flight. Meals were simply a piece of bread with cheese and chicken and 1 service of drinks. The most memorable part of the flight was going to the rear cabin once the food and drinks service was concluded. The cabin crew (6 members) were having a wonderful time socialising with no regard or interest in the passengers. The return flight that I took on the 13th April as the return leg (TU791) was operated by a much newer (2013) aeroplane (TS-IMV). However again clearly Tunis Air have either a very poor outsourced company which do the aircraft cleaning in Tunis Airport or they simply do not clean their planes in order to save costs? At least 1 cabin crew member was on board who operated the flight a week earlier. Unfortunately again the service was a complete repeat of the earlier flight. Tunis Air are under increasing pressure I am informed to perform as an airline who frankly have not for some time. However if this is an indication of the measures they are taking to improve the service then I do not hold much hope for the airline going forward and once EZY start their service from STN-MIR in June I will be switching my business to them.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,,1.0,no

The food was appalling (no starter just chicken and couscous plus an industrial bit of cake) the wine had run out and there was only one beer left. Return flight was worse. Cabin crew still could not muster a smile. Flight was delayed over 45 minutes because of late passengers so we missed our coach connection from Heathrow. There was no food at all because we were told once on board there was a caterer's strike. Since they knew there was a strike why did they not make other arrangements? Why didn't they give passengers vouchers to buy food at the terminal? Why did they not even tell passengers at check-in there would be no food then we could have bought our own?

I believe this was a combination of the British weather and Tunisair but no information was provided beyond being told at check-in the flight would be delayed by 1½ hours. Meal vouchers were provided 1 hour before boarding but by that point I'd already paid for a meal. Flight was OK but vegetarian food was inedible. Return flight was delayed by about one hour. Again no information provided. The vegetarian meal was the same as the flight out ie inedible.

In fairness once we were flying there was nothing wrong with the seats food or service. It was just getting the planes to take off that was the problem! At both Gatwick and Enfidha there were no public announcements at all. The flight from Gatwick was delayed for over 2 hours after the information board had shown that we were boarding. Flight diverted to Tunis because of bad weather and then left in lounge again with no information. On landing at Enfidha we had to wait over an hour for our luggage to come off. On the return trip we waited at the gate4 for an hour saw one plane come in unload fill up with food and then disappear without anyone boarding. We were then moved to another gate but only after other travellers button- holed a ground crew person.

The flight was not exactly cheap. The plane took off nearly an hour late. The passenger next to me told me they are always late. On board there is no entertainment not even in in-flight magazine! The food was poor and my partner's veggie meal didn't materialise a fact which the air hostess took great delight in confirming. He wasn't even offered a snack or an extra drink by way of an apology. My seat was broken so kept reclining even though I didn't want it to which must have been very annoying for the person behind me. Other seats seemed to be having the same issue. The cabin was dated and filthy. We landed only 15 minutes late having made up time but the luggage took an hour to take the short journey from the aircraft to the tiny terminal at Tunis.

If you wanted a beer you asked for it and were given a can. Don't know if wine or spirits were available. Would use again.

The flight from LHR left 1 hour later than the STD however this was due to the aircraft arriving late from Tunis. Upon return the flight left 45 minutes late as there was no Ramp staff in Tunis to load the baggage and hence we had to wait for these to become available to load the baggage/cargo before we could depart. The food even by airline food quality is very poor. However the seating in economy is very impressive both in width and pitch.

The plane was fairly old and tatty but clean and plenty of leg room. The cabin staff were friendly and courteous. The food served was by far the most revolting meal I have ever had. For some reason the plane went straight to Djerba rather than stopping first at Monastir which was great for us and the other 8 passengers going ot Djerba but not so good for the majority of people who were expecting the first stop to be Monastir! There was no explanation for this. The return flight was on time and on a much newer plane again with lovely cabin staff.

The aircraft (A320 both ways) was spotless staff extremely pleasant and the food (both ways) was lovely - at least they serve proper meals which is more than GB Airways have done for years! We even had a choice of meals. Both flights were punctual and arrived early into Tunis Carthage airport.

21151,Tunisair,n,Tunisair customer review,1st March 2007,False,Have travelled on TU about 4 times from London to Tunis generally on time and operated by A320 aircraft. The legroom is ok for a 3 hour flight but food is poor. Cabin crew are ok but dont seem to smile much or show any real interest. The majority of there A320's are getting on a bit as this shows by the minor defects like seats and food trays. If you travel at the right time you can get some great fares on Tunis Air but at peak times like Christmas New Year and other religous festivals it is very expensive for what it is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no

21153,Tunisair,n,Tunisair customer review,20th November 2006,False,GVA-TUN-GVA. Tunisair has a virtual monopoly on this route and it shows. There was nothing wrong with the flight - everything was on time but the personnel on board showed no enthusiasm whatsoever for what they were doing. As an example the pre-flight briefings were delivered in such an indifferent manner (in Arabic and French) that absolutely no-one could be bothered paying attention. Legroom is very minimal just about OK for a 1 1/2 hour flight but not for longer (plane was an A320). Plane is a little tatty inside with no effort to repair minor deficiencies.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no

The flight was okay a new and clean Airbus onboard crew okay. Overall classification - acceptable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
21155,Tunisair,n,Tunisair customer review,9th June 2006,False,LHR-TUN return. Outbound experience was a complete nightmare. Terminal 2 at LHR is a joke. Arrived at check-in 2hrs 20 mins before departure and queued for 1hr 15mins to be served. TU are handled by Air France who handle other airlines in T2. Only 2 check-in desks were open for the bank holiday weekend/half term week. When we did manage to check-in my party of 6 were split up although I had pre-assigned seats on the TU website when I made the reservation in January this year. Called TU reservations in London 2 days before to reconfirm my assigned seats. Flight was delayed 1 hour due to the late arrival of the aircraft from Tunis. TV departure screens displayed boarding so all passengers went to the gate on time and were then told about the delay and could not leave the gate area. The actual flight was very uneventful. Staff were rude and seemed extremely stressed. One stewardess actually pushed a child out the way who was in the aisle. My nephew had a child meal. The tray arrived with a NLML sticker on it (which is actually a Non Lacto Meal). Regular meal was pretty bad on a tiny tray. I opted for the chicken hot which was bland and for some reason was coated in egg/omelette style coating!? Asked for a cup of tea at the appropriate time and got coffee. Stewardess realised mistake shrugged shoulders and walked off. Never got the tea! Had a quarter bottle of local white wine with the meal but it was off and tasted like vinegar (didn't bother asking for another one). Return flight was more successful. Managed to get Business Class seats for us although we were separated but this didn't matter. Flight was an all economy service although there was a business class section. Seat was comfortable but not sure I'd pay for it. Last minute gate change at Tunis without any announcements. Boarding was a bit chaotic with families first then supposedly rear seats followed by forward seats. Could not believe the meal! Was expecting a hot meal on a tray but was given a plastic packed Tuna sandwich (no choice)... No tray either so no napkin no cake/salad not even a cup for tea/coffee. GB Airways last year were much better - just a shame they don't fly out from LHR! Anything good to say about TU?? Book in advance and you could get a really good fare. I paid £105 rtn including tax,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
21156,Tunisair,n,Tunisair customer review,6th April 2006,False,"TU is the bargain carrier between BEY and DXP and it shows. Outbound ex BEY on TU833 on 28 March '06 Y class. My comments mirror Peter's comments from '04 posted below. Flight arrived on time ex Tunis well- handeled on the ground by MEA boarded ontime and arrived in DXB early. Bags arrived. Good. However onboard you realize why it's cheap. The Airbus was dirty seats were broken toilets in disrepair and untidy. No sevice whatsoever for the frist hr of light. Then a dinner service (at 4:30am DXB time!?). Same comments as Peter except that there was no choice of unappetizing tough meat dishes!). At one point I was standing in the aisle and a female fllight attendant approached me from the rear and shoved me into my seat. No ""excuzez moi"" or anything! (A first for me in over 25 years of international travel) I yelled at her in Arabic and all I got was a Gaullic shrug in response. the lights were kept on full force until they finished Duty Free sales. In-flight entertainment was watching the progression on the little o/h monitors. At least it induced sleep! Smiles not returned by the flight crew. Return flight TU834 on 2 April '06 was better - slightly. Poor check- in procedures by local agent kept many of us waiting endlessly while they dealt with a costomer who seemed not to want to pay for his many extra bags. Thus no time DXB duty free shopping despite being at the check-in 2hrs early. . Better plane this time  friendlier crew - but not by much. Better food but no doubt catered in DXB. Don't waste your money on C class. Seats can't be any wider than Y class and in Y class the armrests fold up so you can get some extra hip and elbow room and even stretch out if you are in an empty row. BTW still no English newspapers and only a few flight crew even attempt to speak it. The flight announcements seemed to be learned by rote and not really understood. Anyway its cheap.",,,,,,,,,,,,,no

21158,Turkish Airlines,1,"""dismal to be exact""",26th July 2023,True," The ticketing and flight experiences, both, were not just unimpressive but dismal to be exact. I booked my flight for the family of 4 - 2 adults, 2 children, from ATL to DEL via IST and back from DEL to ATL via IST. In all 4 flights, I made sure to complete seat selection online days before the flight and paid the desired amounts. But both times, Turkish Airlines disregarded my paid selections and decided to change the seats within 24 hours of the flight departure, meaning I did not have a chance to change them online. In ATL and DEL, I had to spend extra time on the check-in counter to have the family sit together because Turkish decided to assign us different seats in different rows of the airplane. The food service as well was very disappointing. While going from ATL to DEL, where we had opted for Asian Vegetarian meals and Hindu Vegetarian meals, we were given boiled spinach, white rice and boiled corn. On the return flight from DEL to ATL, we had not made food selection given the bad experience in our ATL-DEL flight. To our surprise, this time, there were no options in food other than beef. No other meat, no vegetarian options. No apologies from the flight staff, just that ""we do not have anything else"". The staff was handing over the food with beef to passengers without telling them what it was.

Crew is of course very angry and displeasing, you can hardly see more unpleasant people working as crew. Food is universal and dull, for example they also don't want to open a bottle of wine, because another kind of wine is opened, so why not that one. Shocking was also behaviour of captain, who chatted in middle of small alley and blocked way to restroom. I asked him if I can go and he barked ""go away"". I returned a few minutes later and he just opened door to his cabin saying I must immediately leave or he will do consequences. Well, if he wasn't blocking the way so long, I was already back in my seat. And many similar small details and situations clearly saying ""we are the worst airline in the world but we fly everywhere, get used to it"".

21161,Turkish Airlines,3,"""flights could have been better""",24th July 2023,True," Extra legroom not possible for over 65. We booked a flight from Tashkent to Heathrow via Istanbul (12 July 2023). I am 1.97m tall and wanted to pay for extra legroom seat in economy. During booking on website, the seat selection option flagged that those over 65 cannot book exit row. It's first time I've encountered this - having flown on many other airlines where exit row can be occupied by 16 or older and capable of assisting with evacuation. Having accepted that Turkish and some other airlines set a maximum age, I searched the seat plan (Airbus A330-300) and selected extra legroom seats by bulkhead (row 11) - not shown as an exit row. All seemed ok when I completed the booking and paid. Weeks later, I completed the on-line check-in (only possible 24 hours or less before flight) which showed our extra legroom seat allocation, but when printing boarding passes we discovered we had been allocated seats in row 36. The seat pitch is too small for me and most uncomfortable for 5 hour flight. Even painful when passenger in front reclines. There seems to be an unclear or unreliable booking process. Please be warned - if you are over 65 and require extra legroom then don't book Turkish Airlines - or pay more for business class. Another comment which might help some travelers - if you are transiting in Istanbul then make sure your next flight leaves you enough time for transfer. Our flight from Tashkent to Istanbul landed 20 mins late. It then took an unbelievably long 45 mins to taxi a long way around the airport to hardstanding. Another 10 mins to disembark aircraft. It then took us 30 mins walking at a fast pace through transit and bag scan to next boarding gate where passengers had already started boarding. The flights themselves could have been better - toilets were not cleaned, all rubbish not collected (left on floor during landing).

Check-in went super slow and staff were annoyed.  Cabin crew hardly smiled. Food were terrible.  I had a deadly long layover. My first place of departure made me not eligible for the free hotel program. And my layover was too long to be offered a nap room in the lounge. I came to the concierge desk and was told by staff: ""Madam, we have a policy that you can only get a nap room if your layover is between 4 to 9 hours. You can get a hotel outside but you have to pay for it. It's not in our contract."" Online customer service was also terrible. I sent emails asking what I could do in my layover period.

Even though we had a nominal 2.5 hour transit time in IST, ground staff at the departure gate told us that 5 minutes later, they'd closed boarding. Why? First because of late takeoff (by 30-some minutes). Second, it's 15 minutes after landing to taxi to the apron parking. Then buses to the terminal, followed by a long walk from departure area A to F, through an airport that's clearly designed to maximise sales opportunities rather than passenger convenience.  So don't dally if transfering in IST - that's the take-home message. And, not once on an 11+ hour flight (unless I was asleep) did cabin crew come to offer water. For the return, I have a 22-hour layover. I succeeded in having TK provide a hotel, but it's the Mercure Airport at the old Ataturk airport, 2 hours by public transport from the new airport.

As a result I missed my onward connection to HCMC without any proactive action by TK. It took considerable time to locate the TK Office in the vast Istanbul Airport, and the TK Representatives were disinterested, lethargic, evasive and rude before I persuaded them to provide a solution, which was one involving a flight to Dubai and thence to HCMC. Not my choice. Accommodation was not offered, and this involved finding another Office and a long wait. As a result I did not reach my destination until early on 17th July instead of the intended 15th.

They delayed our first flight multiple times due to technical issues and finally after an entire night of delays they cancel the flight but they did not release our tickets to allow us to get reschedule our flights. So we spent all night on the phone with our booking agency and the airline help center but nobody can help us until Turkish Airlines start their shift the next day (not until 10am). When we return to the airport the next day we are told that we have been put on the same flight but when we get to the gate they are already delayed again. After about 30 minutes of waiting the staff have no answers and one of the gate employees even tells my wife ""If you want to make it to your destination on time you should book another flight with a different airline. Turkish Air will reimburse you because of the delays."" So with that bit of terrible advice, we book another flight and try to leave the airport to check in with the new airline. But at immigration we are told that we cannot leave as our tickets have not been released (again) by Turkish Air and we were supposed to be escorted by an airline employee to immigration to fill out paperwork so we can leave. We end up sprinting through the airport as we are told by the information desk that the delayed flight is now boarding. So we finally make it to Istanbul where a Turkish Airlines employee stops all passengers with connecting flights and says he will escort us to our gates. After leisurely walking us through the airport he points down a long corridor and says our gate is at the very end. So we sprint, once again, to the gate only to find that the gate has already been closed and they would not reopen it for the 10-12 passengers who needed the transfer. So we watched as the plane pulled off the jet bridge and onto the runway feeling like we had been slighted once again.

Ist - Rize Flight= Checked in two hours prior to departure, Headed to the special assistance desk to be told that they had a long line of waiting which if we were to wait, we would miss our flight, The supervisor suggested for us to walk through security and catch the buggy service which was easily available, Even though this was very painful task for my older Mother, we did as we were advised only to be told at the buggy company desk which was far further from the security that their service was chargeable as they are a private company! We had no choice but to pay the EURO 10.00 to get to the gate (ONLY) NOT to the aircraft as we requested & booked two months ago! Rize - IST flight: Checked in at the business class separate lounge, I told the hopeless only agent that we booked the special assistance and needed the car lift to up to the aircraft as Mum cannot walk the stairs as the airport has no air bridge at all, She replied confirming that all was in order, When we tried to board, We were told by the SAME agent that she could not get the car lift and that we had to walk up the stairs, I asked for her manger to attend, He told me that I did not request the assistance, I had to show him the original confirmation email, then we got the car lift to the aircraft. Arrived IST, Wheelchair agent was waiting for us as we disembarked HOORAY, the agent assisted us through the jet bridge & left us by the seats at the gate claiming that another agent meant to assist us the very long way to the baggage hall – Guess what NO ONE showed up for 40 minutes and no one was available to assist!

We could of course cancel and get a return flight home for the same cost as the additional flight price, but they informed us that if we were to cancel the entire flight both outbound and inbound would be cancelled, with no refund.

21189,Turkish Airlines,1,"""do not know what I did wrong""",29th May 2023,True,"  At the end of January I wanted to book flights online for the end of April to Turkey in such a way that we first fly from Prague to Istanbul, stay there for a week and then continue to Antalya for another week and then from Antalya back to Prague via Istanbul. But you can't book that online like that, so I called TK customer service and asked how I should book that. The information was that I should book 2 tickets and reserve min 3 hours on the way back for the change in Istanbul. I did as instructed, booked the tickets and also had over 3 hours to change planes, arriving in IST 13:40, departing to PRG 16.45. In the weeks and months that followed, I kept getting text messages from TK saying they were changing the schedule, changing planes, etc. Most of them concerned changes of times because of the time change to daylight saving time, but one concerned the flight from AYT to IST where I was secretly rebooked on a later flight, which I unfortunately did not notice. There remained however still 1 h 45 min for the change, which is well enough. Already on the way to the airport I saw that the flight will be delayed. At the check-in, however, the boarding pass was issued to us also for IST-PRG and the luggage was checked through to PRG. The delay was then according to TK on 1 h 16 min, so quite that is not true, we took a long time to the arrival gate, where we arrived at 16:20. Already on the plane I asked several times how it would work with the connection and the last information was that I should grab the first TK employee at the exit and let him advise me. I did and the TK man at the gate told me to go to the departure gate as quickly as possible. Anyone who knows the new IST airport knows what that means. Nevertheless, we made it to the gate by 16:45 (we are both 68 years old and my last gold medal in the 5000 m run was several decades ago). But of course there was not a soul at the gate. Again I grabbed a TK employee, who referred me to the customer service counter, where of course the obligatory queue was waiting. When I showed the ""Pre-sorter"" my boarding passes, he told me immediately that no more flight today and I should wait here, so that TK look for a hotel and book new tickets. When it was my turn, the lady looked at my papers only briefly, and explained to me that I had no right to any compensation because I had booked 2 tickets. No one responded to my question about how I should have booked and they referred me to the ticket counter next door, where I had to wait almost 45 minutes for my turn. For 2 tickets to Prague they wanted $700! When I went to book the tickets online, I came up with around $500, but the lady told me she couldn't take that fare and I should book online. With the hotel and cab and dinner this story came me to over 600 € about 200 € more than the whole original booking. Since then I have been arguing with TK, repeating everything I'm sure 10 times already, but all I ever get to hear is the gramophone record: ""You were late at the gate and had 2 tickets, we are not to blame"". On my question, how I should have booked differently, is consistent just as little addressed as also to the fact that the TK customer service had advised me to do so.

Got to gate 15 mins before boarding was to start. Told to “wait here and we’ll make an announcement for boarding. Boarding started 35 mins after scheduled time. No announcements. Eventually an employee said business line up over there. And there’s a long line of people who probably were given different info.  Not a huge issue but the bad experience kept getting more irritating. The plane fine, well equipped, very helpful and welcoming staff. But there’s poor info on the website about the seats. Seat map shows 2 seats, an aisle and 2 seats. Seat map of TK website is not accurate, it’s actually one seat, an aisle, two seats, an aisle and one seat. So we were a couple on a 13 hour flight, separated by an aisle and the two seats were offset by approximately 15 inches so we couldn’t even converse across the aisle. Not a fatal flaw but an example of sloppiness. We took off an hour late with no explanation or a “we’re sorry” comment which would have been a nice touch.

I spent 48 hours including 2 trips to THY office at AYT, many phone calls to call center, and submitted several feedbacks. The response to my feedback made absolutely no sense because they were addressing the initial change on my trip I made in March 2023.

This email gave no alternative flights or assistance to get another flight, they said it was canceled. When I called Turkish they stated I could cancel the entire ticket or go home on a different day, not much of a choice. I couldn’t get credit for the second leg, even though they only canceled the second leg. I moved my flight to one day earlier and left my trip on may 2nd causing me to incur charges for the hotel stay for a night I couldn’t use. Day of the flight the flight was delayed over an hour with only a 2 hour connection to my second flight on their airline. I asked if I would miss the connection and they stated I would not and the plane would be held because we would land about 6pm and the flight started boarding at 6:50 pm instead of holding the plane they had an agent get me off the plane as soon as we landed and I thought I was being rushed to my flight, but no they were rushing me to the lounge because they had already booked me on another flight the next day. So I lost another day of my vacation because I had to stay overnight in Istanbul. I also had to get a visa for Istanbul unexpectedly because I had to leave the airport. None of this was explained to me it all just happened. On May 2nd my return flight, we were headed to the airport and our cab driver told us our flight was delayed 2 hours. No email or text form Turkish airlines. We get inside the airport and flight still shows on time, I call Turkish and they said it was on time. Got to the counter and was told by that the flight was in fact delayed 2 hours and we would miss our connection and they knew about it 4 hours prior to me asking. So why weren’t we told because again we are going to miss our connection to their next flight. So I asked to be booked on the flight for the 4th because the flight on the 3rd was canceled (my original flight home). They were not willing to do that all they said they could do was put us on the delayed flight and put me on a later flight to JFK, which now I miss connection from JFK to Florida and I need a hotel in New York.  So my friend and I check in same time with same person, but when I get to JFK I have no luggage and she does. They placed my luggage on the flight to Istanbul the next morning.

21194,Turkish Airlines,1,"""one of the worst flight experiences""",17th May 2023,True," Very poor customer services. On the last flight we were told by ground staff there are not enough meals on board so we wont get any (only in case of leftovers) and we can write a complaint to the airline afterwards. When questioning the crew why we would not get any meal if we have a full price ticket, the board crew reacted very rudely and we received different answers, first as the flight is overbooked and then as we checked in as one of the last passengers (should not matter how many hours before we check as we had a valid full price ticket). At the end we received two meals, but which seemed to be from different passengers who didn't finish or want it, as several items were already missing, and one meal was already opened. However, we did not complain anymore and accepted it. Before landing another crew member came unsolicited to us again and kept arguing with us again in a very rude manner and we should be happy that we received anything and finally she left saying that's not her responsibility. In addition, we were traveling with an infant and did not get offered baby food, while other customers did. When filing a feedback with the airline afterwards, we only got the answer that they investigated but could not find any ""meal service irregularities"" on the flight and also no improper behavior of crew members (wonder how they investigate that). After some forth and back and only the typical prefabricated customer service answers and even some answers that have nothing to do with my complain (e.g. they said I should have informed the crew members - that was actually my complaint, and in a second answer that I would have to submit a doctors report) not addressing the issue at all, I gave up. It seems nobody is really reading the feedback, they only copy past some generic prefabricated answers. In addition, on the return flight our stroller that we left at the gate was handled without any care. We even saw from the airplane window how the stroller was tossed around while unloading (even ground staff I guess is probably not airline responsibility). The stroller and the basket had scratches all over the place. Even the rain cover that we put over to protect the basket to some extent was destroyed. Not to mention the delays of one hour sitting in the airline waiting for departure with an infant on each of our two flights. Overall, one of the worst flight experiences and one of the most impolite cabin crew. And even booked the more expensive TK ticket, compared to low-cost airlines for example, expecting better service in particular as we were traveling with an infant. But it turned out to be a pretty disappointing experience flying with TK and not any better than a low-cost airline.

I flew on Business class on Turkish Airlines for a roundtrip flight to Bali, Indonesia from Montreal Canada with a connection in Istanbul, turkey. The aircrafts were an Airbus A350 and a Boeing 787 which were nice, spacious and seem in a good condition. The seats had plenty of legroom and space to have a pleasant trip specially on long flights but are similar to other major airlines. One issue about the business class seats is that we can't see from the windows because of the seat conception which is inconvenient for a lot of passengers. The flight attendants were not very service oriented and did not seem very friendly. Usually the crew start to take the meal orders before the plane pushes back but on my last leg they did it once the plane was airborne. The crew from and to Bali legs were a bit better. Some of them don't even ask if we needed something else or a drink during the meal service and they took a very long time take the dishes. I had to ask twice to get my drink and another time later for a coffee which was very long to have it. However the food was tasty and good. The in flying entertainment was also good and had many choices of movies and TV shows.

I sent them the visa pages in the passport and all boarding passes and payment receipts. Feedback responded to me that they closed the case and are not going to reimburse. It looks weird. After getting all they needed, they refused to pay and closed the case. Again, I called customer service, and they put an objection on the case. My question is why they waste customer's time. If the Feedback department is not able to do the reimbursement, why does staff tell the customer to go through Feedback to get reimbursed. If the Feedback is able to reimburse, why do they refuse to pay after asking for more documents. It seems no one knows how to resolve this case. Just wasting our time.

21215,Turkish Airlines,1,"""extremely unhelpful""",8th April 2023,True," I recently had an extremely disappointing experience with Turkish Airlines, and I feel compelled to share my frustration to caution others about the challenges I faced while trying to resolve a baggage fee issue. My original flight, TK717, was scheduled to fly from Delhi to Istanbul on Mar 30, 2023, at 6:20 AM, before continuing to Dallas and Toronto. Unfortunately, the flight was cancelled due to a technical issue with the fuelling system. Turkish Airlines provided accommodation and rebooked me on a flight via Air India. The problem arose with my additional baggage. I had already paid for an extra bag with Turkish Airlines, but they failed to carry forward this payment to my new flight with Air India. I had to pay for the same additional bag twice. I reached out to Turkish Airlines for a refund and compensation, but they directed me to Air Canada, claiming it was a codeshare flight operated by Air Canada. However, this is not true, as the flight I am talking about, TK717, was operated by Turkish Airlines. I have tried to communicate with Turkish Airlines multiple times, providing them with the correct information, but they keep diverting responsibility and have not resolved my issue. It is incredibly frustrating and disappointing to be treated this way by an airline I had trusted. Based on my experience, I give Turkish Airlines 1 star out of 5. Their customer service has been extremely unhelpful, and their inability to address a simple issue has left me feeling undervalued and frustrated.

Over a month before traveling, I sent in the request for the stopover (which only needed to be submitted 72 hours before departure). I was sent a hotel voucher for the wrong date and name, so I emailed back to correct it. The Turkish team did not respond to my 5 emails over the course of a month to correct it. When I got to my layover in Istanbul, I assumed that if I explained this and showed the emails, I could get a hotel or some compensation.  Their reason for not allowing my stopover was that there was another flight from Athens to Istanbul the next day that I could have taken and had a four hour layover.

21222,Turkish Airlines,1,"""the worst travel experience of our lives""",30th March 2023,True," We were loyal Turkish Airlines fliers for many years until this experience. Our saga started when we purchased 4 business class segments for my wife and my honeymoon in February 2022 for almost $8K. Due to Covid, we tried to change them over the course of the next year. This airline has arbitrary change fees that are not listed anywhere on their website. They are allowed to quote you whatever fees they would like at the time of the change request. As such, we were told that our new tickets would need to be roughly $5600 to qualify for the change, with an additional $600 per ticket change fees, so $9k in total for a $5600 flight. We agreed, but disputed the change fee with Amex. Amex found in our favor for $600, issuing the credit and we looked forward to our honeymoon. Fast forward, we arrived to the gate in February 2023 for our new flight and were told for the first time that our tickets were *suspended* and that we no longer had tickets. After speaking to ticketing agents and phone agents, both of which said there was nothing they could do (more on this later) we finally were able to speak to the Newark sales manager who was highly unprofessional and unhelpful, trying to convince us that we were not owed anything and essentially ""too bad"". In the end, we were forced to purchase last minute economy tickets for almost $4K with a one way upgrade for $2500, as we did not want to jeopardize our hotel reservation and ruin our honeymoon further. Over the course of the next 2 weeks, like many here, we emailed the feedback form many times (as others noted, this airline's phone personnel have no authority to make any financial decisions and all must be done via online feedback forms). We received many unhelpful responses, refusing to give us any compensation or help us in any way. All references were made to speak to ""our bank."" Finally, we decided to upgrade our economy leg home for another $2500 and take this matter up when we got home. In the end, we paid about $8600 just to have to pay another $8.5K and fly in two 8 hour economy segments versus the 4 business segments we originally purchased. I'm sure that in the meantime, Turkish resold our original seats last minute for much higher than the original $8k we paid 5 months before the flight. In short, this was the worst travel experience of our lives and showed clearly the unethical business practices of this airline. 1) They will suspend your tickets without notice, forcing customers to purchase last minute segments at the gate. There are numerous other cases here of flier having their tickets arbitrarily suspended. 2) You will not be able to make changes, receive refunds or do any customer service action of any value through the phone with them. You will be forced to use an antiquated online ""feedback form"" that does not even track your previous correspondence. There are no personnel in any airport, including in Istanbul that have the authority to issue flight changes, credits or refunds. 3) They do not have a clear change fee policy. If you need to change your flight, be prepared to spend months trying to communicate with them on the aforementioned form and in the end they can quote you any amount, you're on your own.

When in reality, you simply fill in the SG arrival pass and you are good to go. Which I explained and told her exactly where she could find this information.  I turned to the other gate agent and showed my passport and let me on the flight. While on my trip I had my trip rescheduled twice and I spotted something different with my flight. It seemed like my flight had been split up into two single journeys instead of a connecting one. Which would mean I had to check out my luggage and check it in again during my transfer.

When I applied for a refund for my expenses to collect the luggage, I was told that they only allow 21 days to do this upon receipt of the item. I would like to remind Turkish Airlines that people travel for different reasons and mine was to spend time with my 87 year old mother. Do you think I have the time to read the fine print of their carriage rules? Nobody from their office informed me of this when I filed a complaint about my luggage.

I initially booked a return flight on the 7th of January 2023 from Hong Kong to Paris with a 4 hours transfer in Istanbul. With no apparent reason, they decide to move the Hong Kong - Istanbul flight to the 6th of January, which means now I have a 29 hours transfer instead of 4 hours. I tried to ask for compensation, but did not get a single cent. At the phone and by e-mail they either send me to my agency where I bought the tickets or they give me conventional, pre-made excuses. At their airport stand they send me to a Turkish Airlines agency, at the Turkish Airlines agency they send me to their central offices in Taksim.

21242,Turkish Airlines,1,"""I tried to get compensation""",9th January 2023,True,"  My outbound flight was delayed by a couple of hours in Manchester, and I missed the connection in Istanbul. On arriving in Istanbul, there was no apology or direction of what to do, I was stuck in the airport for almost 6 hours. There was no food or drink offered, no accommodation, just a new boarding pass. Having sat in an uncomfortable chair for the delay and waiting for the first flight out in the morning, my flight took off and arrived in Kayseri. I had a bad feeling at the luggage collection and just knew my bad luck was to continue. No sign of my luggage and the conveyor belt stopped. I was told to go to another location of the airport as my luggage was there. On arriving, I was told my luggage was still in Manchester and had not been loaded to my original flight. I registered my contact details and was given a reference number and number on Whatsapp. I was told my luggage would be there the next day. One night without my luggage wasn't ideal but manageable. The next day I whatsapped the number, which was Kayseri airport, not Turkish Airlines and they said it had not arrived and to contact the airline. I had to call an international number, costing me money each time, to get information on where my bag was. I was told later that day it would arrive. I got no call and followed up that day, no luggage. I was in Kayseri for 4 days and my luggage didn't arrive there at any point. 4 days without my own clothes, toiletries, shoes, etc. Each day, I received no communication from the airline and had to call them, at a cost, to see where it was. They had no idea and couldn't tell me where it was or when it would arrive. I had to go shopping on Day 3, to buy new underwear, clothes and shoes, as I could not wear the same clothes the whole time. The airline said keep all receipts for costs associated with this and I would be compensated. My luggage finally arrived in Istanbul airport, when I left Kayseri after 4 days and 4 nights without my luggage. It cost me over $200 to buy new clothes, taxis, phone costs, etc. It ruined the 4 days in Kapadokya.  On returning home, I tried to get compensation for the lost luggage, which has been a nightmare. They did compensate me for the delay, per EU rules, however they will not meet my costs for the delayed luggage, not even paying me enough to buy new clothes and essential items. They were responsible for ruining my holiday to Kapadokya, yet they will not compensate me for these 4 days, let alone meet the essential costs. No apology, no responsibility, just automated answers about how they love treating their customers as a priority and look forward to welcoming me again. I would avoid TK if there is another option, their customer service is severely lacking, they have no care for customers who want to enjoy Turkey and boost tourism.

Generally speaking, the flight staff on the plane are friendly, but that is the only positive thing about this airline. In my example, the flight was already rebooked on the outward flight because of Turkish Airlines. The situation continued on the return flight, when they once again rebooked the return flight two weeks in advance at inhuman times with eternal delays. As if that wasn't enough, they cancelled this already rebooked inhumane flight 10 hours before departure. Turkish Airlines only needed a short email to cancel without any possible contacts or other options. At the airport, the fun really started. Seeing that the flight was still available and that more and more people with the same problem were piling up, Turkish Airlines still didn't have enough reason to act. 10 minutes before the end of check-in, they were content to calmly do something. However, without success and above all without compensation or even an ""apology"".

However, they said I would get an airline credit for $813 which I could use towards a ticket in the future. - Provided I made my reservation by Feb 23, 2023. The travel date could be for a future date AFTER Feb 23, 2023 as stated by the reservation agent - I could use the credit for ANY destination in the world within their network (again not true, it had to be the same route) However, I tried to make a reservation in December 2022 and now they tell me that there is a change fee of $270. Which was not communicated to me. Also, they said that I have to travel AND RETURN by Feb 23, 2023 which was not communicated to me. Finally, I opened up a ticket and after hundreds of calls back-and-forth with imbeciles operating the phones at Turkish airlines.

21251,Turkish Airlines,1,"""avoid flying with this airline in future""",30th November 2022,True,"  Terrible experience. Started with a very poor check-in experience using their appp, and wouldn't progress past the seat selection stage where it kept glitching so I had to do it on my laptop instead, and then the app wouldn't show the boarding passes. Then, at the gate despite an announcement saying boarding would be by seat number, it was simply a free-for-all and the staff didn't even try to order things. I was in the middle passengers to board the aircraft. As I was at the end of the tunnel just about to get on the plane, the airport staff brought down passengers with mobility issues or requiring assistance. Myself and another passenger stood aside as asked (and as you should do) to await these passengers being boarded. Turns out that was a big mistake - several other passengers pushed past us (and those with mobility issues), which is relevant later. When finally aboard, it was clear that the flight was overbooked as noone could find anywhere to put their bags and the queue in the aisle was very long and slow. The passengers who had shoved past were getting their bags slotted into the last remaining spaces by crew. I also noted one gentleman who had severe mobility issues and who had been brought to the aircraft by wheelchair being asked to move seats by a crew member and struggling to do so with no assistance. Then I was told that my bag would need to be put in the hold. I tried to protest, explaining that I had intentionally travelled long-haul with hand luggage only to avoid these waits at the carousel and potential delays and missed connections, and had had recent terrible experiences with this, but the crew were entirely unhelpful and just chucked lots of our bags in the hold. These are all people who boarded around the middle of the cohort, so I can only imagine how many bags were relegated to hold in total. There were no reminders from staff to remove important or disallowed items from bags before they were taken to the hold - hopefully noone left their passports in there! This was all followed up by one of the most uncomfortable seat experiences of my life - and that's coming from someone who can sleep pretty much anywhere. There was barely any legroom, the seats weren't particularly comfy and as soon as the person in front reclined even slightly the screen was practically in your face. Arm rests also in an odd position. No USB or other charging points which is quite unusual these days. Not woken for my meal, so didn't have anything, and was only lucky to catch someone's eye long enough to get a drink.

21254,Turkish Airlines,1,"""It was the worst experience""",29th November 2022,True,"  It was the worst experience that I ever had. I bought 3 tickets for myself, my wife and my 19 month old son since we need extra room when we are flying. We flew from Los Angeles to Tashkent via Istanbul and back from Tashkent to Los Angeles after spending 2 weeks in Tashkent with 3 days stop in Istanbul. We really liked Istanbul and it's touristic attractions. We bought tickets via Expedia and I paid full price for my son's ticket. When checking in in Istanbul TK representatives told us that we have to buy new ticket for our son since the one we bought was a child ticket, but it has to be a baby ticket as our son is under 2 years old. They told us that on previous 3 hops TK made a mistake allowing our baby onboard and they sent us to to a ticket office where I got charged an additional 130 USD for a new ticket for our son. It's the kind of Turkish Bazar experience you get when you deal with TK. It was a very stressful situation for our family as we were almost late to our flight to LA. I was very angry and was not able to sleep during our flight to LA. It's a completely different experience with Turkish Airlines in other countries as in Tashkent/Uzbekistan and Los Angeles their representatives are more customer focused. 3 years ago I had another bad experience with Turkish Airlines in Istanbul when TK oversold tickets to our flight to Los Angeles. They push people who bought tickets in advance with cheaper rates to stay and chose a different flight making a priority for those who paid higher buying tickets closer to departure date. That creates a stressful experience for the passengers since they don't have seats on their boarding passes. They first push you that you don't have seat available and later gamble proposing bonuses to passengers to abandon a flight and you have to stand firm to take your flight. Somebody agrees at the end to abandon a flight. Our Turkish Airlines experience was so bad that it spoilt our impression about our vacation in Turkey. We would try to avoid this airline and country in overall for upcoming vacations. ",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Istanbul to Los Angeles,November 2022,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,no

It was fast and expeditiously served without the personnel being rude, dismissive, or in a hurry.  Some bad turbulences were well handled. People may think that there isn't much an airline can do about turbulences, however, I have flown a lot in this lifetime. If you pay attention, there is actually a lot that can be done.  I have been on many flights where I expected something like the felt slippers to be provided. Feet can start hurting and aching when stuck in hard shoes for 10+ hours. Nothing was ever provided. Restrooms were very clean. I have paid more for tickets for shorter flights on hyped airlines where strangely it wasn't feasible to keep the restrooms clean.

Around an hour into the 6 hour flight a male FA plonked himself down in the empty seat across the aisle from me, reclined the seat and then watched a movie on his smart phone. When the seatbelt sign came on for landing at Birmingham the crew went through the motions of pre-landing safety checks, but did not ensure that seats were upright or that window blinds were open.

I read the reviews for Turkmenistan Airlines before I flew, and thought that if I went in with low expectations then I couldn't be disappointed. I was wrong. The outgoing flight was delayed by 2 hours with no apology and worse there was nobody to be found to explain what was going to happen with our planned changeover. No one at Heathrow knew how to contact them or were even aware that they flew from the terminal! Most of the food was inedible and the in-flight entertainment non existent. Our return flight left Bangkok at 4.40am and when my boyfriend asked for a blanket he was told they were only for business class passengers and babies. The lack of organisation at both check in and flight changeovers was laughable, I've lost count of the number of hours we have wasted standing around in chaos.

Fortunately we could still check in and did not miss our flight to India. Staff are a bit disorganised. Seats were allocated so couples sat on opposite ends of the aircraft which did not make any sense. The return flight was due to leave at 9am but did not depart until later in the afternoon. We were not provided with any refreshment or information during the long delay. The aircrew were miserable. No in flight entertainment and food was average to tasteless.

21270,Turkmenistan Airlines,1,Turkmenistan Airlines customer review,22nd August 2015,False,"We normally use Turkmenistan Airlines regularly to fly to India. Have been doing for over 10 years. We will never be flying with this airline again. On the way to Amritsar on the 31st July the crew on the flight were so miserable and safety was of no interest. Although we made it clear I couldn't eat meat when I booked the ticket, they ran out of vegetarian food when it got to me. They just dumped whatever on my tray. I asked what it was and they said lamb. I told them I'm vegetarian and I can't eat this. They said it's all finished and snatched the lamb from my hand and started having what I can only describe (due to the tone only as I couldn't understand the language) as a dig at me between each other. They never seem approachable and quite frankly they come across very annoyed if you call for them. On the way back from Amritsar the wait was only supposed to be 2 hours max. The flight way supposed to leave Ashgabat at 1:30pm but didn't leave until 6:30pm. I get that all flights can get delayed but it's the way the issue was dealt with. First of all we were not told that there was a delay and when passengers started questioning they just struggled their shoulders like they couldn't understand English. Around 3pm they put 4:30pm departure time on the board and when it hit 4:30pm still nothing. Around 30-40 passengers got together to ask where our flight was. The manager said it's gone to Dubai and we asked why. She said she will be back in 2 mins and never returned. The others persons we questioned just kept telling us to go away and were actually laughing at us all. Very offended. There were Turkmenistan Airlines staff in the background looking at us and laughing amongst each other. When I finally got home I realised this is a regular thing. They say 2 hour wait but I'm facts it's been 5 hours for all three flights which my friends were on because the flight goes out to Dubai and back whilst we have to wait. We were never informed of this at all and if I knew I would never have agreed to fly with them especially because of the prolonged wait.

Flight was comfortable but never ending due to lack of entertainment in-flight. I strongly advise you to take a laptop or tablet with you as the flight is long and never ending especially the journey from Birmingham to Ashgabat. Ashgabat airport is lovely and gives you a chance to stretch your legs. There is a bar in Ashgabat airport which provides western food and alcohol. Overall I'm impressed with the airline as the fares are relatively cheap and you get where you want to on time and hassle-free.

Heathrow to Ashgabad 3 seats together for my family which is what I would expect Ashgabad to Amritsar they split our seats how on earth can an airline give a 3 year old a seat on the other end of the aircraft by themselves one seat at back of aircraft one in middle and one at the front.

Waited at Askerbad for approximately 90 mins while crew changed and 757-200 was refuelled and cleaned out. Plane does look a bit dated now no entertainment so bring your own staff are friendly enough and respond to your requests 2 meals and a snack and plenty of bottles of water. Flight back was 2 hours 45 mins to Askerbad and 7 hours 30 mins to Birmingham all went to clockwork only hiccup was some of the luggage was not put on the plane so we filled in a form and handed to the Birmingham Airport rep to forward luggage home by a courier.

Cabin was shabby and in need of refurbishment! Pilots made no announcements. Flight back to Heathrow I was upgraded to business class without asking. The seat was obviously bigger but lacked the foot extension you get with Emirates business class the seat was also in need of replacement due to shabby arm rests. Service on return flight was very good flight attendants friendly and spoke fluent English. Food plentiful and a choice of three dishes also provided with a flight pack pillow and blanket. All in all flight home was great because of the comfy seat that allows some chance of sleep.

The crew struggle with English but we managed to communicate without too much difficulty. Aircraft's were clean and tidy and legroom good. There is no inflight entertainment aboard however the inflight catering was rather good washed down with a generous supply of soft drinks. What spoilt the experience was the behaviour of a minority of Amritsar bound passengers who chose to openly smoke during the flight. When approached by the crew those passengers screamed and shouted that they could not understand the crew requests for cigarettes to be extinguished. These passengers chose to play very loud music to the annoyance of those nearby refusing to turn it off. Fellow Amritsar-bound passengers were powerless to stop them.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes

Plane clean and staff could speak enough English to make themselves understood. The drinks trolley came around every hour or so but no alcoholic drinks. There was no entertainment onboard apart from a map showing where we were. Landed on time at Ashgabat airport. The transfer lounge was adequate - we waited approx 90 minutes before we continued onto Amritsar - we sat in the same seats so no new boarding passes were required. We arrived on time at Amritsar. The things I didn't like about this airline were that it was no longer cheap - in the UK they have put their prices up by 50% from last year. Also they don't have life jackets - something that petrifies me as I panic when flying. One other moan I have is that whenever we hit turbulence - and we did quite often - there was no announcement telling passengers to return to their seats and put their seat belts on - children were playing in the aisles as we went up and down!,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes
21283,Turkmenistan Airlines,n,Turkmenistan Airlines customer review,5th March 2011,False,A nightmare journey to Amritsar due to leave at 1350 from BHX. On arriving for check in we were informed the flight was delayed 11 hours - spent all day at the airport. On boarding the flight the staff were rude and unhelpful - not even fully conversant in English. The flight was due to land in Ashgabad for a short break but the pilot took the aircraft to Mary Airport due to bad weather - and left the aircraft as did other members of crew. The passengers were left sitting on the aeroplane for 4 hours prior to it taking off for Amritsar. There were insufficient drinks onboard and we were not able to leave the aircraft. Staff could not update us on when we would leave Mary as they had to wait for another aeroplane to land so they could get back up to full crew. I will never fly with these people again they offered no apologies for the gross mistreatment of the passengers.

21284,Turkmenistan Airlines,6,Turkmenistan Airlines customer review,28th December 2010,False,Ashgabat - Dashoguz return on B717. Outbound had interesting boarding arrangements - you get a numbered generic boarding pass (with a picture of an Ilyushin 76 cargo plane on it) and you have to refer to your ticket for your seat number (at least the seat allocation is honoured). Aircraft interior was comfortable and well presented - they now have safety cards but still no sick bags and no life jackets. Picture of the President is displayed on the front bulkhead Small sandwich served and additional items can be purchased at prices lower than those at Ashgabat airport. Landing was not the most confident. Look out for the fleet of Antonov AN- 2s at Dashoguz airport. Inbound also interesting - no conventional check-in counters everyone queues at a plain doorway for security etc. No boarding passes. Aircraft interior was clean and well presented - I didn't use the bathroom but others reported it was not in a good state.

Even though I asked a flight attendant to intervene she asked the gentleman in vain to comply with security instructions but finally gave up and just walked away. I had to call her again tell her I would report her and the gentleman in front of me to the police after landing until she asked the purser to show up and solve the problem.

The flight attendants speak mostly Russian or Turkmen so it is hard to communicate with them. Overall you get what you pay for.

Food and service is what you would expect from the price of the ticket. The return journey was a little more complicated because of the volcanic ash. Everyone was asked to check in and several hours later the flight was cancelled. They should have phoned everyone not to come to the airport. I was travelling with my young son and 2 daughters which made it difficult. They did provide food water coffee etc and the taxi fare back home to the village when the flight was cancelled.

Flight attendants all Russian and Uzbek don't speak or understand English or Punjabi. They are rude whenever customers ask for help with their suitcases or hand luggage. The food is not nice drinks are served loads - every 1.5 hours. Entertainment poor very poor bring your own books magazines and iPods/MP3s. All they have is a screen showing you where you are in the world. The safety manuals are in Russian. If you were travelling to India you would want films music and games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no

At Ashgabat its dirty - very dirty. Nobody speak English or also nowhere you can read normal information. On the way back the problems bigger - the seat was broken and when you fly 8 hours on a seat that's broken than you have a problem.

21292,Turkmenistan Airlines,2,Turkmenistan Airlines customer review,17th October 2008,False,I have flown several times with TA but rarely enjoyed the trip; made worse by the lack of everything one associates with a decent air carrier. They dont have staff who can speak English no particular manners and in general they are rude. No information in English or Hindi/Punjabi on board or at Ashgabad. How one should know what to do or expect in term of time for board? I think they treat passengers with contempt and anger directed towards them; I have witnessed the so call air hostesses being rude. As for the onboard entertainment the less said the better. They make all announcements in some language that not a single passenger understands - I know they sometimes have one air hostess who pretends to speak English but no one can understand as it simply isnt English! The occasional films they show are in Russian and always highly embarassing for Indians. Overall I would rate TA 2 out of 10. You may say why 2 when the whole service is so diabolical. Well they usually let you sit down in a sort of seat and if you dont ask for anything they dont hit you over the head. And also because usually flights are on time. Would you fly with this thing? Well as for me and all my friends and family I much rather take a Maruti from Birmingham to Amritsar (if I had the time) than subjecting myself again to this humiliation frustration insults and torture lasting almost 12 hrs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no

Each flight on-time and aircraft were clean. Food on the international flights was Indian vegetarian both ways - very good out of Amritsar quite acceptable coming the other way. Complimentary soft drink and snacks/beer for sale on domestic flights. Departure tax from Ashgabat included in ticket price - apparently this is not the case with other airlines. One or two quirky things - there were no sick bags on any of the flights and safety cards only on the International ones. My complaint is with the International baggage people at Ashgabat who extracted money from me in both directions - on arrival for retrieving my bag from the carousel (it was the only one) and on departure because the combined weight of checked-in and cabin baggage exceeded 20Kg.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
21294,Turkmenistan Airlines,n,Turkmenistan Airlines customer review,27th February 2007,False,I flew with Turkmenistan early February 2007 from Birmingham to Amritsar. The outgoing flight was 10 hours late at Birmingham but we were not given any explanation what so ever for the delay - apparently it was due to fog in Amritsar? We were given a £5 voucher to spend on food & drinks which bought you a couple of coffees! Food and inflight service was adequate. Return flight was punctual but the temperature on the plane was very warm and therefore most uncomfortable. Despite a requests from passengers nothing was done other then to hand out a glass of water to each passenger. Food on the Amritsar to Ashkhabad part of trip was poor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
21295,Turkmenistan Airlines,n,Turkmenistan Airlines customer review,3rd December 2006,False,Central Asian carrier on which I flew five segments in November 2006. Beijing (PEK) to Ashgabat (ASB) and back a one-way flight from Mary (MYP) to Ashgabat and a round-trip between Ashgabat and the northern town of Dashoguz (TAZ). All flights were on Boeings with 757s on the international legs and 717s domestically. The pilots were allegedly Western-trained and looked Russian but none said a word during my five flights. The planes weren't bad. The seats were maintained and the cabins were clean. There were other signs that this wasn't the Delta Shuttle. The bulkhead wall at the front of each cabin bore a framed photograph of the President For Life. Many passengers paid no heed to any rules about seatbelts or cabin movement. Boarding the plane was all pushing and shoving and the old ladies had the best moves. Aside from a flight map on the 757s there was no in-flight entertainment. The food was standard airline grub and flight attendants were reasonably diligent if unenthusiastic about serving drinks and responding to the call button which the passengers pushed without hesitation. There was no in-flight magazine. Luggage limits were nonexistent but in a country where almost everything has to be imported I was sympathetic. The space on my flight was so oversubscribed that three trucks of baggage were left behind. The stranded bags were to arrive on the next flight with room. Turkmenistan Airlines has no web site. It has no frequent flyer program that I could discern and is not part of any alliance. It serves the major cities in Turkmenistan in the sense that it connects them to Ashgabat. The foreign destinations include London Beijing Moscow Bangkok and Istanbul. Flights through Ashgabat are cheap; flights to Ashgabat are expensive. Turkmenistan Airlines is cut- rate transportation which isn't so bad if your expectations are low.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
21296,Turkmenistan Airlines,n,Turkmenistan Airlines customer review,15th March 2006,False,"Had heard bad comments about this carrier but gave it a chance anyway. It should only be given 1 star. LHR to ATQ via Ashkabat. Check in was the same as any other airline. As soon as we boarded what can I say? Miserable crew standing to ""welcome"" passengers on board as if they had been forced to do so. I think 95% of the passengers were Indians so TA need to think about having at least 1 punjabi/hindi speaking crew member for announcements. Other airlines do this such as Royal Jordanian and Gulf Air. But with TA it was all in their own language and an attempt in very poor english. No announcement from the captain what so ever. Food was ok not much different from other airlines I suppose. Drinks served soon after take off. TA seriously need to improve their inflight entertainment the map of the flight path just isn't good enough! I personally would not use them again I'd rather pay just a little bit more and fly to Delhi and have some decent service. What makes it worse is that they don't even have a proper office (not that I know of anyway) to put comments forward to. Its not necessarily to complain but more to give ""advice"" to the airline because they seriously do need to improve.",,,,,,,,,,,,,no

At this point, I get worried and went through check in any way in case there was a problem with the screen and it never changed. I went into the airport and could not find anyone from Uganda Airlines to check my baggage. I asked and some employees say I had to wait. I waited for 30 minutes until I get scared something is wrong and I was going to miss the flight. I was told to leave the airport and go to the UA office to ask what was happening. Once I got there, the employee told me my flight was moved to Friday Dec 2nd. I did not receive any notification with this information! I was allowed to check in on Wednesday! The screen in the airport had the flight there and it said ""on time"". I had nowhere to go, I was not offered accommodation for those two nights. I had no cash on me. It was a terrible experience. I spent 6 hours at the airport wasting my time - 3 waiting for the flight and another 3 trying to figure out what to do. I was crying in the airport and booked somewhere to stay until Wednesday, having to spend a significant amount on accommodations and food for those days. I remember a lot of months ago when I was choosing between this airline and another and I picked this one because it was cheaper.

The aircraft was perfectly clean in both flights, and the cabin crew quite professional and kind. I especially appreciated the leg space available, far better than on most European economy class seats experienced. A snack was served during the 1.50 minutes flight, that included a chicken sandwich, a fruit juice, a small bottle of water and a banana. More than enough for a mid afternoon flight. Worth mentioning is the kind support that I received at Uganda Airlines office in Entebbe, when facing an administrative issue that could have badly affected my trip.

Waited with 2 kids in the flight till 11.40. got one small badam packet, water and a burger as dinner. Again around 11.40 received an update the crew just reached and still searching for bag.

Got announcement that collect luggage in drop 5 and the bags were being sent slowly almost taking 1.5 hrs even to get the luggage. Also they asked one counter will be open till 3 am and we have to rebook if required before 3 am.

Also, the crew being unable to receive answers from their management is unfair to them. They’re out in front of angry customers who just want to go home.

21317,United Airlines,1,"""wouldn't conceive flying Polaris again""",21st July 2023,False," Polaris class SFO-PPT and back. Never again. First, check-in for Polaris at SFO was surreal, with 50+ people on line and only one agent actively checking Polaris-class passengers in. I found myself longing for the business-class check-in desks at the other, non-U.S. carriers in the International Terminal, carriers that actually seem to offer a premium service to people who have paid for it. I arrived at the terminal two hours before my United flight but got only 20 minutes in the lounge as a result of this mess. Second, United's boarding process is a slap in the face to passengers who pay upwards of $7000 for a seat in Polaris. If you're not a member of one of their frequent-flyer levels, you're forced to board with economy-class passengers. Every other airline in existence lets passengers in the premium cabin board first, before the coach stampede starts with people pushing and shoving to board so they can get first claim to overhead space. This is one reason why I will never fly United again. Third, my berth in Polaris was filthy, with lint and crumbs littering the air vent along the bulkhead. Fourth, the food in Polaris was virtually inedible. Again, when you're paying upwards of $7000 for a ticket, you expect something that isn't going to make you gag. Unfortunately, United is the only airline apart from budget carrier French Bee that flies from SFO to Tahiti nonstop. For any other international route where there's competition, however, I wouldn't conceive of ever flying United Polaris again.",Boeing 787-9,Couple Leisure,Business Class,San Francisco to Papeete,July 2023,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,1.0,no

When I called long distance from Italy to try to get another flight (there is no UA office at the airport), the customer service rep didn’t fix the error, didn’t book us a new flight since we missed the first one by trying to get the name corrected, and hung up on me. This left us stranded in a foreign country with NO ticket home as a result of their error. I called back again and finally got tickets back to a different airport and my daughter and I had to find our own way back from New Jersey to CT, taking four different trains with our large suitcases in tow.

As it was a retrofitted 777 with proper Premium Plus seats, it was not bad. LAX is certainly not the best airport, as the boarding area was tiny, thus very crowded. The Premium Plus seat was comfortable. We had the first row with huge legroom, more like 55-in rather than the normal 38-in pitch.

The flight departed on time and arrived early. The 787-10 was the highlight.

I get to the Jacksonville airport at 5:00 am for a 6:30 flight. At the boarding and luggage check booth, where there were nearly 100 people waiting, there was one attendant on duty - it took a solid hour just to print my boarding pass and check my luggage. All other airlines had several attendants working. After sprinting to my gate, I found out that the flight had been delayed for 3 full hours. When we finally boarded, I got a message saying that my connecting flight to Rochester had been cancelled. After standing not one, but two customer service lines, I was able to book a flight to Syracuse. Originally leaving at 9:30, the flight was again delayed by an hour. We landed at 12:00 am, but taxied for another 40 minutes because the airline had sent an unscheduled flight to our departure gate for cleaning. Never in my life have I experienced this level of negligence at an airline. On transferring to Syracuse I asked the customer service representative if I had to re-check my baggage. She told me ""no"", and that I was ""in the system"". I asked the concierge at the gate for Syracuse the same thing - he said ""no"". After deplaning, I discovered that my luggage had been left in Newark. It is now 11:00 pm the next day, and the luggage has just now been delivered to my hotel.

We were advised to see a kiosk with an attendant on it waited 30 minutes and we still couldn’t get checked in. At this point we had a little under an hour to get everything done yet no one knows how to get my boarding pass printed with my lap baby. My husband was able to board but I missed my flight. They told me to wait on a line that took over 2.5 hours to get to a rep and that as far as they are concerned I missed my flight even though there was still time. I had two employees bicker in front of my family because the employee asked another employee to assist and she didn’t like that we were thrown on her. After I waited for 2.5 hours to get this situation rectified the rep told me there was nothing he can do because the confirmation was split once my husband got his pass and I essentially lost my reservation and had to wait 1.5 hours to get ahold of a reservation specialist on the phone. FYI they don’t have reservation specialists in the airport. United employees doesn’t take responsibility or try to correct the situation. I was left to make other plans with another airline company as being stranded in an airport with a toddler wasn’t going to work. I went to JetBlue and they had zero issues with processing my lap baby’s pass. United doesn’t care about their customers, if they had it there way I would have been stranded for two days. Also they are unbelievably understaffed and we’re cancelling a lot of flights. There was a mob of angry people. Save your money, they may be worse than southwest and spirit at this point.

We had to take a Taxi from Regan to IAD while carrying our luggage: $75. After we boarded our 10 PM flight from IAD to Amman, it circled around for 2 hours then it was cancelled. We stood in line waiting for a representative to serve us from 12 (Midnight) tell 10 AM (10 hours waiting, not kidding, while standing, in the airport). They put us on a new flight to Dubai, and then to Amman, the next day. We stayed in Dubai for 11 hours (took a hotel in the airport, at my own expense). We added 2.5 days extra to the trip. These 2.5 days were lost from my vacation with my two daughters. And at the end, the customer care team insults me with giving me a credit of $125 towards my next flight to cover for the horror story they put us through.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Amman via Washington,June 2023,1.0,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,no

Unfortunately, united is now on the do not fly list that I created today. I am newly married, and on both legs of our trip, even though I booked the airline tickets at the same time, my wife and I had to sit in separate rows. apparently, their policy is that unless you pay to buy your tickets, the computer will just put you wherever it can even though you’re married and flying together. This is such a ridiculous policy and one that has cost them two new customers.

And so on, we took the bus about 6 times back and forth, it was crazy! And during this time, NO ONE INFORMED US! During the evening the board kept changing terminals, gates etc. I went to ask a representative from United. The dialogue went like this: Me: I would like some information about Flight 1482 please Rep: It is cancelled Me: ?? But it is on the board? Rep: Yeah, the plane is here on the airport. Then she gave me a card, informing me that I shouid call their support. I waited in the telephone for 70 minutes, then I was disconnected. We also tried to go to customer center, the queue was about 1000 meters! We were at the airport 7 hours, no information, unpleasant staff, and no help. Finally, at 11:30 pm, we rented a car and drove all the way to Florida.

21342,United Airlines,3,"""customer experience is not important""",12th July 2023,True,"  I think, it would be a very beneficial eye opening experience for Scott Kirby to fly as a regular customer during bad weather conditions. Spend time in a long line for the travel assistance for rebooking the flight, and then trying to figure out where to spend a night or few nights before the next flight. I was coming from a wonderful European vacation on July 9th. As soon as I arrived to the Newark airport, I received a very unwelcome message that my connecting flight was canceled. The next 4 hours were extremely frustrating. The United App was not working. Long line to the travel assistance full of frustrated customers, elderly people, and parents with young crying children kept growing. A travel agent informed me that a seat for me is available no earlier than July 12th. I registered for the standby for the earliest flight the next day as well. I, as every other person in that line, needed to find a place to spend a night, possibly 3 nights. The agent was kind enough to give me 3 vouchers $15 each. I am a full time employee and have responsibilities. So, I had to inform my manager about my encounter. The next day I spent “camping out” at the Newark airport on a standby list. The overbooking practices help maximize the profits and brings hefty bonuses to the top management of the airline at the expense of their customers. In Europe airlines are penalized with high fines for overbooking. The airline should be able to develop a backup plans for bad weather, and not use it (bad weather) as an excuse for inconvenience, keeping travelers stranded for days, passing down the operating cost to customers. Seems like customer experience is not important for United airlines. ",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Phoenix,July 2023,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,yes

Rebooked in for a new flight, 40+ hours was the wait. Newark was my connecting flight location. Toronto was my final destination. Before finding out about my cancelled connected flight, my check in baggage was rechecked in. Since I was spending over 40 hours in the airport, I spoke to United Baggage Counter Service 3 TIMES! To know the whereabouts of my bag, and I wanted it with me during my wait in the Airport. The 1st time, I was told that even though my bag was rerouted, I could collect it and have it with me, then I could recheck it in before boarding my new flight to Toronto. I was told to do this by visiting baggage service the next day. The next day is here, it is my 2nd time. I was told it'll take 12 hours for me to retrieve it, ""look out for it at carousel 9"" I was told. And I could recheck it in. The 3rd and final time I spoke to Baggage Counter Service, this person behind the counter told me something completely different, he said that since my bag has been rerouted, I no longer have access to it until my final destination. And I was PROMISED that it will be with me on my new Toronto flight. 3 times, with 3 different answers. Saying that, luckily I saw my bag on carousel belt 9, attached with the reroute label and all. I picked it up to get my phone charger which I really needed. I asked one of the baggage workers if I could keep my bag with me and I will recheck it in myself. They said NO. It's in the system, and it's guaranteed to be with you. I finally landed in Toronto and not only did my bag not show up, but I found out that it's still in Newark Airport! I know this because United Baggage service in Toronto tracked it for me. Having been already frustrated waiting around for 40+ hours, now I have to deal with another problem. Again, I was guaranteed that it will be with me. I've already made arrangements to get it delivered to an address, it'll take 2-3 days for me to receive it.

21354,United Airlines,2,"""trip was an unmitigated disaster""",9th July 2023,True,"  I have flown United Airlines and its Star Alliance partners many times. However, this trip was an unmitigated disaster. Our departure to SFO was delayed by 3 hours because the flight crew was delayed getting in to DFW and needed their 8 hour rest. This meant we would miss our connection. As it turned out, the connecting flight was cancelled. The agent at check in would not rebook us on another airline nor put us on standby. Our bags were checked through to YVR. The agent in the United Club put us on standby for the next flight from SFO. Unfortunately, we could not get on this flight nor 2 other flights that we were on standby status. As a result, I ended up booking one way flights on another carrier to Seattle, stayed overnight and then took the bus to YVR so we could attend the first of 4 wedding events. The flight itself was fine; however, the baggage is another story. Our bags never made it to YVR. I spent countless hours texting with United Baggage over 5 days. We received conflicting messages about our bags being in YVR. We missed a pre-wedding soiree because we spent 4 1/2 hours at YVR airport looking for a bag that wasn't there and had to buy every day clothes plus clothes for the wedding. On Monday July 3, I received a phone call saying one bag as in YVR. I requested the bag to be delivered to our hotel. On the day of departure from YVR, the bag still hadn't arrived. I received a call while going through security that 2 bags would be sent to DFW and delivered to our home address. The bags were delivered to our home on Friday July 7. The garment bag that was supposed to be delivered to our hotel before departure on 7/6 is still in United's baggage system. 24-48 hr delay is excusable; however an entire 8 day vacation without baggage is totally inexcusable. This is the first time in all my years of travel I have encountered such poor baggage service. I'm inclined to not use United again, but then I would lose my Premier access status with its Star Alliance partners.

We have one of the largest Airports in America, therefore, I understand the 2 hours plus rule. From the time I arrived in Newark, it was a terrible choice. My first leg on United Airlines was ATL to EWR, I arrived to Hartsfield Airport (ATL) to discover my flight would be 1 hour and 45 mins delayed. Not a big deal to most but I had a connecting flight to Denmark, Europe. As it got closer to the boarding time, an United assistant began to yell on the microphone, ""Y'all have to hurry and board or we will go illegal and you will have to wait longer"". If anyone came up to ask a question, ""Y'all have to hurry and board because we are about to go illegal"". She informed us, they would start boarding sooner due to them about to go ""illegal"". Finally, we are all boarded on the plane, we waited an extra 30 mins to taxi due to them allowing another United flight that was supposed to depart at 10ish pm to board our flight, they said we were not full so they could get more passengers on my flight. While this delay occurred because we have multiple people with the same seat. These genius people did not think about this. Secondly, I arrived at Newark, and it takes United 30 mins to get an associate to hook up a ramp for passenger departure of the aircraft. The pilot continues to apologize over the microphone several times. I literally had 5 mins to get to my connecting flight; it was pointless to even run during this time. I reached the United help desk to informed them I'd missed my connecting flight due to their delay, the woman assisted me by trying to get the next available flight but all of them made me miss my anniversary, which is the day I would have arrived to be with my spouse. At this point, they give me a hotel because I had an international flight. I asked several times if my bags would be on the new flight I'd been given, the United assistant reassured me they would. (It was not on my next flight after delayed for 10 hours.) The assistant gave me a meal voucher of $15 for breakfast and lunch. They provided a Lyft to the hotel, by this time, it was 12 am. The hotel was about a 20 min drive, and I felt like I'd passed a million hotels to arrive at such an unsatisfying one. You would have thought I was in a motel 6. After a 10-hour delay, I started my travel back to Newark (EWR), my international flight was on time, I was so happy to be away from this unprofessional airport. The staff was horrible going through security check out. I arrived to Aalborg, Europe to discover, no one knew where my bags were. I'd missed my anniversary and now I have absolutely No clothes. Returning flight: From Aalborg, Europe (AAL) to dreadful Newark (EWR), I arrived at Newark Airport (EWR) again but this time I had an 8-hour layover. I'd learned from my first experience to just take the extra time if you can. I put myself into the Newark International Airport Marriott, which is only 5 mins from the Airport.

We arrive 2 hours early here in Birmingham to be told your flight here has been delayed and you will miss your connecting flight in Houston to Los Angeles. You have the choice to stay here in Birmingham or fly to Houston and we will provide a hotel room. Okay we chose to fly to Houston because who knows what could happen. We end up in a storm in Houston no fault to United Airlines but the issue is we lost a day in Honolulu and our room there was already paid for no refund issued. So we fly 7 1/2 hours straight to Honolulu on a crowded flight having to sit in the middle when our seats were originally by the window. So I didn’t get the beautiful view of what I wanted to see. The food was terrible because we received a salad no dressing and I was thankful we ate dinner. The flight back wasn’t even better. We got delayed in Los Angeles because the flight attendant was late in Honolulu. Then we go to customer service and they did accommodate us at another hotel with food vouchers. However the experience was horrible because most of the staff was rude and disingenuous on how to handle customers. Things could have been worse but paying for baggage, being re-seated on every flight was all too much and even with them putting us up in hotels. We still lost money and a day in Honolulu. I say this to say we stayed humble through the experience but it was still not enough to repay for our losses. Also on the flight home from Houston there was no wi-fi service so that sucked.

First, my flight at 5:40 was canceled just hours before it was supposed to take off. I decided to go at 3 to wait on standby for the next flight to Chicago at 4:45, which is what was recommended on the phone by United Customer Service. I was 6th in line. The 4:45 one left and I was unable to get in. I waited for one at 7:30 but was also unable to get in. However, by that time, they told me that I am 2nd in line and had to wait 4 more hours for the next flight. I found out about an hour before the next flight at 11 that I was kicked off the waiting list for no reason. I tried to find anyone from United to speak to about this but there was absolutely no one there to help. One of the later flights at 11:30 kept getting delayed till about 1 in the morning, and as for the other flight, I was informed that I was, once again, the 6th in line.

Every time they just say “go to customer service” or to “additional services” but the lines are huge. No one wants to wait there and take time out of their day just for them to reschedule the flight and then cancel it the day before or the day of the flight. Worst part is that they sent out our luggage to Orlando while we are still in Houston. So now we were left without luggage even though United Airlines told us that they will not send our luggage until we are sent out to Florida but come to find out they sent it out either way.

Today our plane was late leaving EWR, as the plane did not have enough fuel. 2 weeks earlier on another United flight the delay was because the crew had slept in.

Not only have they now ruined this wedding they try and stick me on standby on a one stop flight, surely losing my first class seat without refunding my paid upgrade no doubt. I don't care what they say about weather or traffic control their airlines is trash. The way they treat their loyal customers is trash. Their fleet is old and trash. Their food is poor. Their loyalty program is terrible because they have too many 1k'ers. You pretty much have to pay for an upgrade if you want one. I finally got a flight on one of their FEW newer planes and they cancel it. I'm going to get on every review site I can think and tell people to fly Delta.

21375,United Airlines,1,"""do not fly United""",29th June 2023,True,"  We had book a 10 day vacation to Israel. We were first delayed in the Salt Lake Airport for 8 1/2 hours, missing our connection by several hours and being forced to stay in San Francisco for about 16 hours until the next flight from there left to Tel Aviv. Now, this by itself was very frustrating and meant we would miss a whole day of our vacation, no vacation and no work meant we were losing money by the hour, add onto that was the unhelpful attitude of the flight crew, the several different reasons given for delays (ranging from weather to flight crew deficiency, to plane malfunctions) and this was just a really bad day. We stay in San Francisco for an entire day and are back at the airport for the new flight. Now, the airline did provide us with a hotel (pretty bad one that smelled like smoke) and a few food vouchers, but we weren't very happy with them. The next flight gets delayed again and again until finally at about 2am (was supposed to leave at 8), they cancel the flight for another set of ambiguous reasons. at this point, there are 400+ angry people waiting in one line with about 2 agents and they are turning people away without so much as a hotel room. At this point we decided we would not be flying United, we've missed two days of vacation or work, we've been treated poorly and compensated only the bare minimum. We finally speak to an agent and demand monetary compensation as well as a refund for the cancelled flight (airlines are required to refund cancelled flights), and they refuse. They tell us there will be compensation but where, when, how is left ambiguous. We ended up flying Delta, completely smooth as wonderful process. Though we continually call, fill out forms, send emails, and the like, we have yet to see a dime of compensation for this truly terrible experiences. We stayed in touch with some other people on our flight and they continued to have problems with United (missed connections and the like) and were never compensated. The best that they were able to do was offer $300 vouchers for another flight. Are you kidding me? You think a silly $300 voucher could make up for the money we lost and the horrible experience we had? Not likely. As we are never planning to fly United again, a voucher is honestly just an insult at this point.

21377,United Airlines,1,"""lacking in empathy and extremely aggressive""",29th June 2023,True,"  I am one of the unlucky souls who booked a flight with United in late June 2023. I had to end my vacation in the Caribbean to return to Canada for a family emergency. What was supposed to be an 9h trip turned into a four day nightmare that cost me upwards of $2800 USD in out of pocket expenses, in addition to the original ticket price. I was shocked to find some United employees incredibly lacking in empathy and extremely aggressive. On day three of the ordeal, a customer service rep at Newark took a cursory look at my booking, claimed I was rebooked on an air Canada flight and was “no longer a United passenger.” I told her, the booking was not complete and Air Canada had explained (after I had gone back and forth between the two long queues) that United had not actually booked me, it was more of a temporary hold. The United staff refused to even speak to me, even as I begged tears streaming down my face explaining I had a family emergency. A manager then aggressively threatened to call security if I didn’t step aside because I “had already used up 30 minutes of their time,” which she knew was a blatant lie. I then had to go back to Air Canada and then called United on the phone, all of which was useless. I finally booked myself on a new ticket, via the United app, travelled to another terminal (C) and waited for 8 hours only to have that trip cancelled as well. I was now approaching day 4 so feeling utterly defeated, I booked myself a business class ticket home from Newark with Air Canada. It cost me $2300 USD and was a red eye with a long layover in Quebec City, but that flight DID make it and I’m now home. I think United deserves to be sued for its failure to support and look after the wellbeing of its customers. Shame on them and on lawmakers who allow this level of negligence and disregard for passengers’ wellbeing (see reports of the atrocious conditions in some terminals especially Newark terminal C).

Due to the long wait my cousin needed to use the restroom, but the gate attendant refused as the isle chair is not for travel throughout the airport. I left after 10 minutes of arguing between the gate and flight attendants (who were helping us) to avoid a serious embarrassment. When we returned, no one was there anymore. Another gate attendant at a different gate made 4 separate calls for chairs not only for my disabled cousin, but another elderly lady also waiting an hour for assistance. We spoke to a manager about this absurd wait. She was apologetic and took our information.

21401,United Airlines,1,"""refused to compensate us""",18th June 2023,True,"  Shocking treatment by United Airlines of 2 elderly people and an infant, leaving us stranded and paying over $1,000 for hotel + food over the Boston Marathon weekend - and when we filed a complaint, United refused to compensate us even one cent! We were flying from Boston to Calgary, Canada via Newark with my two elderly parents (one of whom has a back problem and gastrointestinal issues) and my 5 month old baby, who was flying for the first time in his life. On the morning of our scheduled departure, United told us that the Boston-Newark leg of our journey was delayed because of an earlier delay impacting our plane’s arrival, meaning we would not have sufficient time to make our Newark-Calgary connection. We spent over 2.5 hours on the phone with United trying to find an alternative flight, but were informed that the earliest available alternative was not for another two days on April 18th, 2023, even though we showed great flexibility e.g. we were willing to connect via a different city, split our family up so we flew on different airplanes, and / or accept a longer connection time. Despite this, United said there was absolutely no option for us to fly for another 2 days. They also confirmed that the reason for the earlier delay was boarding of the aircraft taking longer than expected, which was within their control. We looked ourselves into flying with another airline, but the cost of such last-minute tickets was thousands of dollars per passenger and therefore prohibitively expensive. This meant cancelling our United flights and getting a refund was not a feasible solution. United did NOT offer us the option of arranging a flight with a different airline carrier without additional expense, which is contrary to our rights under Canada's Air Passenger Protection Regulations (APPR). We therefore accepted the new United itinerary on April 18th. We were appalled that United was not able to re-schedule us for two full days.  Our destination city of Calgary is not a small town - it has a population of 1.45 million people and a very active international airport. We were stuck in Boston during the very busy Boston Marathon weekend, which forced us to stay at an expensive hotel 2 more nights than we planned as we could not find last minute accommodation elsewhere. We incurred additional meal costs and transportation costs to the airport. Our total additional expenses during our delay period WAS USD 1,110. We filed a detailed complaint with United Customer Care. It took them close to 2 months to reply to us, and when they did they vaguely blamed the weather (first time we heard of this excuse!) and refused to compensate us at all.

As expected, the flight boarded late and we departed 20 minutes behind schedule. The plane was full. Unlike other airlines, they limit carry-on baggage to 5 kg (instead of 10 kg), but I don't know if this is strictly enforced. (My bag was just over 10 kg, so I checked it.) That said, it seemed that the in-cabin overhead storage was less full then typical, so maybe this restriction has a positive effect by reducing in-cabin baggage and, by doing so it quickens boarding time. The plane was a not new but did not have signs of excessive wear. The seat was cramped, and my knees we pushing into the back of the passenger in front of me, especially when he decided to recline. Not very pleasant. The meal served was a bland, chicken sandwich with mayonnaise, cheese, lettuce, and the standard slices of cucumber that one typically gets on all Russian airlines. The flight attendants were polite and business-like. After arriving at Moscow-Domodedovo, the wait at baggage claim seemed long, with a big time gap between the first wave of bags and the second.

Well everyone does it why have an empty plane to Chita when we can have full one to Ekaterinburg. Makes sense so why have it on the timetable at all. Everyone does it she insisted. When I asked what we were supposed to do for three hours she shrugged her shoulders said 'Do what you want I don't care' When we started boarding they had put everyone onto a Il-86 and from there the service improved. The plane which was a bit worn but well looked after was big enough to accommodate our stroller in its cargo hold rather than the luggage hold and the cabin staff made an effort to be friendly and helpful.

I did contact customer service through their site and nothing, they said they would address the issue. You think they would at least have offered to pay for my bag on the return trip or given me a sandwich or something. Yes I did do economy but it was still over a $1000.

21432,US Airways,1,"""staff were just plain rude""",15th October 2015,False,"The US Airways flight from Heathrow to Philadelphia were fine and so was my domestic flight to Memphis. However, my return flight via Charlotte to London Heathrow, was a complete nightmare. We taxied to the run way on time to me told by the captain that a fault (which he said they knew about and should have already been fixed earlier that day) had occurred, it was nothing serious and we would go back to the stand for the system to be rebooted, then we would be on our way. Well, the reboot took place, pushed back from the stand to be told the fuel switch over light had come back on and we would have to return to the stand for engineers to take another look as reboot hadn't worked. Sat on stand for ages, then the captain said anyone who wished to leave the plane, to rearrange connecting flights, or to stretch their legs was welcome to do so and return to the plane at anytime. I was travelling with my disabled mother, but was worried as my father was due to travel 2hrs to collect us at Heathrow, and due to the time difference was about to leave her home in the UK. I asked a stewardess if it would be OK to leave my mom on the plane while I just step outside to make a call. Her words were ""no problem"". I left the plane and was told I had to go past the barriers at the departure gate, which I duly did. I managed to contact my father and asked the ground crew if I could return to the plane. The man was so rude and said no way, can't get back on the plane unless we tell you. I tried to explain that wasn't how it was told to us and I had my disabled mother onboard the aircraft, he shrugged his shoulder and walked away. I then noticed a woman staff member, who was talking to another couple, I waited at a distance, no saying a word as I didn't want to interrupt their conversation, but the women staff member turned to me and said, ""don't interrupt, I'll deal with you in a minute"". I was totally stunned at her attitude. Well, eventually I did get back on the plane but only after explaining about my mother and what the captain and stewardess had said. Eventually everyone was allowed back on board as we were told the plane had been fixed. Again we pushed back to be told fault had reappeared and engineers were going to replace a value. Again we were told it was fixed, pushed back, and, you guessed it, fault reappeared. This time we were told by the captain, even if the plane could be fixed a new crew would have to be found as they were now illegal to fly. This took place over 6hrs! One half filled cup of water and a packet of pretzels were given within those 6hrs. Then came the announcement, the flight was cancelled. Everyone got off, but my mother needed a wheelchair which took ages to come so by the time we got out to the departure gate we were last in the queue. Eventually given a flight home, 24hrs later, told couldn't get us a hotel as NASCAR was in town, given a cot to sleep on and $20 in food vouchers, but this was after midnight and no food outlets were open. When it was bought to the staff attention, the lukewarm food from the plane was given to us. My mother couldn't sleep in the cot provided so spent a sleepless night in her wheelchair. This episode was a complete nightmare, most of the staff were just plain rude, with two exceptions of the ground crew at the departure gate.

It was a 1.25 hour flight to our connection. The next flight they didn't even have us sitting next to each other. She was two rows behind me on the opposite side of a full plane, with both of us having middle seats. Nobody trades you seats for a middle seat. We had three planes to board out of San Diego on our way home. Not one time were the seats next to each other. Why offer me a opportunity to reserve my seats and then not give them to me. Was it because someone paid the extra fee to take my seats? Probably. I sent US Airways an email to ask them why this happened. Their response was sorry, I hope you choose to fly with us in the future. The flight attendants are rude. The customer service is horrible. There is no chance I will fly with them again.

As a result I had to be rebooked and was told I was rebooked on a flight at 6:45pm resulting in spending the entire day in the airport and missing work and several appointments.

I am an 18 year old college student, and I was hours away from home and an hour from school. The representative I spoke with was rude and unwilling to help me.

The attendant told us we were wrong, so we made the move per request, then quietly pointed out we had been in the correct seats all along. The attendant apologized, but didn't ask the other passenger to move to his ticketed seat.

Well, we had a gut feeling ""should"" wasn't enough so we went to another counter.

We wouldn't have eaten calmly and taken our time to do things if we were told that to begin with!

We had no choice so she met us as we landed and tried to help us find an airport nearby our original location for a friend to pick us up at.

If I'd known I would have been irritated but at least I could have prepared!

She rudely says no and then offers no further response. When we finally deplaned we asked the agent at the gate if she could please contact our flight. All she did was give us directions on getting to the B concourse. After a sprint to the gate we barely make it on the final boarding call.

As I am tall the bulkhead prevented me from stretching legs out at reasonable angle you would normally expect - straight was not possible. Outbound flight to PHL from LHR was with BA and was usual solid service but this was shocking by comparison and not worthy of the fare at all (had this been a night flight I would have walked back off the plane in disgust and gone with any other airline). I urge nobody to pay for Business on this route if with American from Philly until they put the modern seats in. Entertainment is provided by a Samsung ipad like device - which is good but means you put it away when food comes they aslo take them all back way before we landed so did not get to finish two movies on a 6hr flight. Tray table can not come out and sit flat unless I am sat up right - this is a nuisance. I did not like the food one bit.

Being that it was our honeymoon I decided to call US Airways and find out the cost associated with upgrading our seats. However upon my conversation with the attendant was promptly made aware that the actual flights we were on had changed and our plane was now scheduled to depart and arrive at completely different times. Not only did they replan my arrival and departure times for me but they took it upon themselves to change my seats and not even assign me to two on my return flight. I am not going to say my honeymoon was ruined however when a merge causes a company to become so big they begin rearranging your plans it begins to make sense why they shouldn't happen. On a side note if we switched the situation and decided to change our flight instead we would be paying a $200 change fee and the difference in ticket price each. Not once were we offered an upgrade for the inconvenience or a partial refund for the change of flights which appear to be less expensive.

I was told flatly that all flights were full and overbooked until 10pm the next day. I was told rudely to 'take the 10pm flight or leave it' and as it was due to the weather it was not their responsibility to offer anything else (in fact the weather was just one of the contributing factors for the cancellation - the plane had already been late). I had to push and push to be offered alternative options (e.g. flights to a different airport or with layover etc). Eventually they found a flight via Philadelphia the next morning. I asked for more details and then agreed to be put on the flight only to be told I had taken too long to make a decision and now that flight was also full! I overheard other passengers being rebooked for other morning flights in adjoining desks so I have no idea what was going on.

When booking flights it asks if you are travelling with children which I was yet not one of the three adults that were travelling were able to sit with the child. When we land in Philadelphia we go directly to the gate so that there will be no worries of us missing our flight. The time comes when we should be starting to load the plane and my husband goes and asks when will be boarding and they inform him the gate has changed which they had not announced. Us along with most of the people sitting around us run to the new gate. When we arrive they there is a delay because they have to bring in a new plane once the new plane arrives they have to clean it after an hour they tell us there are problems with the plane. We wait again and they announce the pilot has run out of time and they need to bring in another. Our 6 pm flight ends up leaving at 11.30 pm. When they do start to board the plane the lady starts yelling at everyone to hurry up like we were the reason for the plane being so late. The return flight comes around and I am thinking surely this time things will be better - wrong. We look at our tickets to see if by any chance we will have someone to sit with my son on any of the flights No. Then I notice that on one of the flights I do not have a seat number. I go to the counter and ask what does this mean and I am told I have to check at that airport when I arrive. I ask does this mean I will not be on the flights? Oh no you will be. I get to that airport and am told the flight is full I will have to wait for another flight. I said no I am travelling with three other people my husband child and elderly mother - I then wait for hours in another airport. In the end I did get on the plane. Will not fly US Airways again if I can help it.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,0.0,,1.0,,1.0,no
21519,US Airways,n,US Airways customer review,6th April 2015,False,I had a 4pm flight scheduled from Boston Phoenix last Thursday that never took off until 8 because they couldn't close the passenger door. We wasted money waiting around for our delayed flight and the only compensation we had was one free alcoholic drink on the way over. Then on our return flight they couldn't find my fathers information and would not let him on the flight. He had to pay an additional 500 dollars to board and now has to wait to be reimbursed.

21520,US Airways,6,US Airways customer review,6th April 2015,False,Reasonable experience on recent flight from Philiadelphia to Miami. OneWorld Emerald member so used the lounge which was actually quite good. Flights on time aircraft clean and crew attentive - inflight meal ok. Cannot believe that US airways does not have inflight entertainment come on it's prehistoric! My other slight annoyance was that when I enquired if I could catch an earlier flight (checked in very early) I was told that would be $75 - my flight was full but the earlier one was less full...just appears to be cheap especially as my luggage caught the earlier flight (and I thought airlines tried to avoid unaccompanied luggage!).,,,First Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,,1.0,,3.0,no

21524,US Airways,n,US Airways customer review,24th March 2015,False,"It seems that US Airways doesn't realize that ""flight"" is not the entire customer experience. The experience begins well before the flight and ends well after the flight. We flew to SFO from PHX this week. We were issued boarding passes and noticed we were in Zone 5. Well since the seats are reserved that didn't seem to be a problem until during boarding a gate agent came to my wife and told her that they were checking her bag ""because there wasn't any bin space left"" and we could go to the carousel at SFO to pick it up. My wife's bag is not large but it does have rollers and it seemed they were ""confiscating"" every bag in Zone 5 with rollers. We boarded the aircraft and discovered there was loads of bin space. I approached the First Class Cabin attendant and said I'd like to retrieve my wife's bag he said ""no it's already gone."" I asked why they were telling passengers there wasn't any bin space when there clearly was plenty of space. He offered a ""well they don't actually check it's just that at about this time in boarding there isn't much space left."" On arrival in SFO we thought well at least as the last bag loaded it'll be the first one off the carousel again we were mistaken. At least 50 bags came off before our bag and not a quick 50 bags. We discovered on our return flight (we returned from San Jose Airport) the same protocol was used by the gate attendant. Our bag was the last carry on allowed all the others were collected and checked. We realized at that point since there was plenty of bin space again that this is a ""convenience"" move by US Air their convenience they don't risk a late ""push back"" if people are seated faster. Of course ""their convenience"" translates into ""our inconvenience."" Why not board 5 minutes earlier? The plane was there all arriving passengers had been off for at least 30 minutes prior to our boarding. Moral of the story - my wife said ""I don't care how much more it is to fly Southwest we're never flying US Airways again.""",,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,0.0,,0.0,,4.0,no
21525,US Airways,2,US Airways customer review,24th March 2015,False,Never again. My wife and I bought seats together for our round trip from Baltimore to Phoenix. Our seats were not honored both ways. Staff were not helpful. On the return trip the gate attendant was eating a sandwich while helping customers. Every single US Airways flight at the terminal was oversold. If it wasn't for volunteers we would have had to wait 8 hours for the next flight home. The plane was dirty and dusty. They don't even provide any free snacks. You had to pay $4 for a tiny bag of peanuts. Bottom line is if you want to sit with strangers possibly not make your flight overpay for snacks and sit on a dirty plane this is the airline for you.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,,2.0,no
21526,US Airways,3,US Airways customer review,19th March 2015,False,"I am extremely dissatisfied in US Airways customer service. Our flight to CLT from BOS was delayed due to not having a flight crew and CLT was not allowing any flights to land so we were assured that our connecting flight to MBJ would be made. When we finally got to CLT the flight attendant informed us that the flights were ""on time"" meaning their original time as we were in the air heading to CLT so we were not able to make our connecting flight. He was not able to give us any information (which is ridiculous) and we were promised that there would be US Airways staff at the gate. Of course this was a lie we had to wait in a 3 hour line told there were no other flights to our all inclusive resort told to get a hotel that the airline did not pay for we were in line for standby only once we got to the airport at 6 am. The kiosk assistant tried to split the 3 female travelers up heading to a foreign country after we had each paid 870$ to fly together and then found there were 3 seats on the next flight which demonstrates her incompetence.

One of my daughters was traveling with an eight year old and a three year old. The children were placed in different rows and seats on a 7 hour flight and told there was ""nothing they could do."" Another daughter of mine had an infant and was twice placed in an exit row being told A) They cannot sit there B) You will have to find someone to switch with. (No fault of their own when they assigned the seats). My daughter was also told on our third flight that they could not gate check the baby's stroller. For what reason? No idea.

Our flight left JFK one hour late the Captain said he was waiting for paper work to be signed. We therefore missed our flight to Asheville the US Airways staff at Charlotte were very rude and could not care less. I had to beg to use a phone to call my cousin who was picking us up in Asheville to let her know what had happened. The agents at Charlotte said there were no seats left on any flights leaving for Asheville that day or the next I asked what should I do they said not our problem and shrugged their shoulders.

21529,US Airways,2,US Airways customer review,9th March 2015,False,We recently travelled via US Airways to St. Lucia Virgin Islands. Our return flight home was routed through Charlotte N.C. Here we were scheduled for a 3 hour layover plenty of time to get through Customs and Immigration and re-check our baggage for our final destination. However the plane was one hour late in boarding in St. Lucia. Upon our arrival in Charlotte we were told there was no gate open for parking at the airport so we waited on the tarmac for a half hour or so. Then we were told there was no ground crew further delaying our de-planing. Once at the gate we were told that Customs was backed up and we were made to wait for another half hour on the plane. At this point we had 1 hour left to get through Customs and Immigration re-check our baggage and run to our gate actually only 45 minutes as the plane cannot be boarded for the last 15 minutes before take- off. My husband had TSA pre-check on his ticket however I did not. I had to go through a very long security line. My husband went to the gate to notify our plane that I was on my way - hurrying. Just as I finally ran to the gate (just at the 15 minute before flight mark) the flight attendants closed the door to the gate and would not allow me to board. I begged as there was still 15 minutes until take off they would not budge. We went to the ticket counter and were told that it was the last flight out and that there were no flights available the next day. So with no way to get home we rented a car drove all night and arrived back home 8 hours later without our baggage. We were met with rudeness and a complete lack of sympathy from customer service when dealing with the airline. By the way our flight from St. Lucia was to have meals available for purchase however by the time the attendants reach our seat in the 19th row there was no food left. We had not eaten all day.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,,1.0,no

This helps to avoid the usual heavy traffic of Moscow. UTair uses a new terminal A which is quite handy.

21552,Uzbekistan Airways,1,"""Safety was not a priority for cabin crew on this flight""",7th November 2021,True," Very disappointed with Uzbekistan Airways service, from boarding until landing in Tashkent. Booked flight with my kids from DXB-TAS on the 7th of November. It started at the airport in DXB, where I requested to get seats in the forward cabin, as it is challenging with small kids to move with luggage all the way to the end of the cabin. The ground staff asked the supervisor if he could offer us forward cabin seats, he refused. He was rude not only with me but with the poor ground staff who was trying to tell him the correct procedure. I have flown many times with Uzbekistan Airways and I have noticed that he has been super rude with passengers and staff at all times (in Dubai and Sharjah). When I came onboard, surprisingly I noticed that there were so many empty seats in the forward cabin! So why did he refuse a mother with 2 small kids to offer a comfort? I assume he is backed up by someone, because this kind of unacceptable attitude for so many years and nobody takes any action! Inflight: - Safety was not a priority for cabin crew on this flight, for take off some windows were dimmed, some were bright - I had two obese passengers sitting through the aisle (35E,F) for take off with their seatbelts were not fastened. Grooming of the crew was extremely poor, especially 2 crew who were seated in L3/R3 door. Male crew who worked from the AFT was not interested to serve us and other passengers, he spoke to us as if we were at the military and he was the general with us, soldiers. When he was serving lunch, somebody asked him for a glass of water, he said that he only has white wine on top of his cart. When I asked him what chicken was served with, he had difficulty in answering. He saw me struggling during disembarkation with kids and my luggage, he didn't even offer to assist us to disembark the aircraft - Not to mention that lavatories were dirty throughout the flight. On this flight the crew didn't smile and welcome guests, they all gave impression that they were forced to come and do this flight, except one who was super positive and welcoming from boarding. During the flight she came and checked on us if we needed anything. Sadly, she was the only crew who worked and valued her job.

I had some apprehension about the flight but it proved to be a fine experience. The well experienced 767s were smooth and comfortable and on the first flight had a rudimentary IFE system which had its quirks that nearly resulted in a finger tip blister! (On the return flight on another 767 there was no seat back screen but instead had roof mounted screens that were quite useless). The cabin crew were friendly and the meal service was very adequate and I certainly wasn't hungry afterwards. Perhaps because of the age of the aircraft I felt that there was more room as they had a 2-3-2 seating configuration and on both flights there were many unused seats and even complete center rows of 3 seats left vacant for sleepers had I wanted to.

Boarding was smooth and prompt (probably helps the flight was only half full), we pushed back near enough bang on time and from there had a very efficient flight to London, landing circa 35 minutes early. As mentioned the flight was only half full, it regardless there was plenty of legroom, over head lockers are very large, the whole cabin felt spacious. The only problem was the temperature, the plane felt like an oven for the entire journey. The in flight entertainment, whilst not particularly extensive, had enough to keep you entertained with a decent selection. The food and drink offerings were the only real negative.

Inflight staff - rude behaviour, gave water after 20 mins of asking and later denied for water when asked for 3rd time. Veg food not available and food available only as per counting, if extra food asked for, denied. Even fruits were denied stating that only the packet of nonveg available if required could be given and separately fruits cant be given. Pillow and blanket was denied stating that you have neck rest which works as pillow so not needed and you have jacket which could be warm enough so blanket is not required. Alcohol (only red / white wine available) which was denied when asked for 2nd time stating that the flight had only 1 bottle (of white wine) which is finished so cant be served repeated later on however 1 glass of red wine was offered stating that only 1 extra glass can be given. Peanuts denied 2nd time stating that per passenger gets only 1 packed and that's finished. I was first time international traveller I was not aware how to order veg food for flight online due to which I asked for Support for getting veg food for connecting flight which was replied that it's not their job to guide how to order veg food, their job is just to serve what ever is ordered. The staff was talking to passengers with rude tone with the ones who tried changing seat as the flight was empty. At Tashkent Airport, the transfers staff in charge of issuing boarding pass didnt know how to process the boarding pass taking about an hour for completing the process resulting into delay in flight.

I paid a little extra for the exit seat and got a huge space for legs, etc. The personnel on board was average but meals were excellent and abundant, the in-flight entertainment system worked well (funny English dubbing by a Russian speaker, one voice for all actors in movies).

A week before we departed Singapore they sent an email to inform that flights home to Singapore are cancelled. We wrote in 3 times with no reply, called the Singapore office and the guy was impossibly unhelpful. We had no choice but to make our trip blindly and hope for it to get settled over in Tashkent. Our flight departing Singapore was delayed by an hour plus, and transit in KL, it was again delayed another hour. It happened the same for our flights home whereby new transit was in Jakarta, it got delayed an hour an half. We barely made it to catch our flight home with MH that the airline booked us home on. My luggage was left behind because of this. Flight crew were not friendly, barely smiled no matter how polite we tried to be. And they never once served water after the meal service. We had to keep going to ask for it and they always gave an unhappy look. Seriously, I don't know what kind of service industry this airline is in, because there wasn't any at all. The food from Singapore was okay, but the food from Tashkent was awful. Tasteless and dry. Our flight home was a night flight, yet the lights were not switched off for sleeping. It was a really suffering 18 hours journey home, with no food and no sleep and with unconfortable seats. Such a pity because the country is so beautiful and the Uzbeks are really nice people.

We were preparing for this flight for long time, because flying with so little children is not a simple task. Before us there was a considerable selection of companies that offer the flight to Bangkok including some Israeli companies with flights even cheaper than Uzbekistan Airways. After much deliberation, we did choose to fly with Uzbekistan Airways because we also realized that the company has improved in recent years, and in terms of flight time with small children it suited and it was important for us to land early in Bangkok, since we had a flight from Bangkok to Koh Samui Island. And from there boat to Koh Phangan Island. The last boat leaves at 16, so landing in Bangkok at 6:40 am promised us an early arrival to Samui without having to stay there overnight but straight to continue to Koh Phangan. I would like to point out that on this journey we left with the full weight, since we are planning a long stay on the island. So it was very important for us that the road be continuous and without unnecessary stops with children and so many luggage. In practice everything happened the opposite! The flight from TLV was delayed in 5 hours. Not speaking about the food and the bad service during the flights, we arrived very exhausted to Bangkok at 13pm. We waited for 3 hours for the next flight (Our flight was at 9:40). We arrived to Samui much later after last boat to Pangan. We had to search for a hotel, carry all the suitcases and children. We arrive to Phangan in delay of day, which included all unexpected and unwanted expenses for taxi, food, lodging, not to mention the levels of fatigue we all came to.

Fast and efficient check in at the Domodedovo airport with a ample lounge to relax before boarding with great drinks and food choices. Boarding process was a bit chaotic, the plane was full and there was no separate line for business class so it took a while for agents to check documents and boarding passes of everyone in the long queues until I was allowed to board. 3 friendly flight attendants greeted me aboard the beautiful cabin of their new Boeing 787, took me to my assigned seat, hung my jacket, and offered me some champagne, with a refill shortly after. They spoke very good English and were genuine friendly and courteous. They distributed noise-canceling headphones, newspapers and magazines, a cool amenities kit - a nice touch since this was a 5-hours flight - and the landing forms, plus informed lunch would be served shortly after takeoff. Cabin was very nice with ambient lighting and logos and touches of Uzbekistan Airways. Seat was very comfortable but not as private as if it was on a 2-2-2 configuration. Since I had an empty seat next to me, I had all the privacy plus lots of additional space. Right after takeoff, a flight attendant came to offer hot towels, additional drinks with a few small plates, and a food feast began. Several courses were served and I was very impressed by the quantity and quality of the food presented. Even though they did not offer a printed menu, stewardess brought several choices of appetizers, salads, soups, main courses, and encouraged me to try different combinations. Also the desserts, I agreed with two choices, but they brought more and everything was high quality and well prepared and presented in porcelain with Uzbekistan colors and logos, very classy. Shortly after lunch, they offered a tablet with several movies and music programs to choose from. Flight attendants keept checking passengers by offering more drinks, blankets, etc. until Captain has announced the approach to Tashkent. After landing, they went to every passenger to thank them for flying with Uzbekistan and to welcome to their country. As the airplane parked at a remote stand, a bus assigned to business class passengers took us to a private arrival lounge, where private immigration and customs facilities were offered, and the whole process went quite fast.

Our fellow travellers in Economy were pleased with their journeys except that they had no choice of food. On the outward and return journeys there were not many Economy passengers. As a result they were able to sleep across three seats. Business Class was full. We read dire reviews of Uzbekistan Hotels too that were completely unfounded. The City Palace Hotel in Tashkent was excellent by any standards. The Asia Hotel in Fargana was another excellent hotel in rooms away from the noisy road. Don't believe everything that you read about Uzbekistan transport or hotels. I hesitate to label previous contributors as 'moaners', but that passes through my mind. Hotels tend not to supply plugs for basins and baths - take your own. Uzbekistan is a developing country and making a good job of it.

21585,Uzbekistan Airways,8,Uzbekistan Airways customer review,28th October 2014,False,LHR-TAS-LHR seat 3J (a window seat) in both directions. A good experience all-round and with a Business Class fare at a little over a thousand Pounds excellent value for money. My flight was operated by HY's latest 767s which come with comfy seats AVOD iPads loaded with films and games attentive service and excellent food. The cabin is decorated tastefully with a blue and cream theme. The eastbound flight is an overnight operation so I slept most of the way. The seats recline but do not go fully flat not even to angled lie-flat. Nevertheless they are comfortable enough and I achieved about six hours sleep so on arrival I was ready to dive straight in to activities on the ground. Breakfast was a choice of sushi and antipasti which were both of high quality. The westbound flight was operated in daylight hours and I enjoyed it a great deal. The stewardess was extremely attentive and the food including traditional Uzbek plov was excellent. Note that seats in row 1 do not offer stowage for slippers glasses books and so on whilst rows 2 and 3 do. Also note that the airline does not provide a toothbrush kit or other amenities so be sure to pick these up from the Skyteam lounge at LHR T4 ahead of departure.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,,4.0,,5.0,yes
21586,Uzbekistan Airways,4,Uzbekistan Airways customer review,1st October 2014,False,LHR-TAS-LHR September 2014. Step back in time with Uzbekistan Airways. Plus points - on-time in both directions reasonable ground experience felt safe some staff efficient and multilingual and completes London-Tashkent in half the time of the alternatives e.g. Aeroflot. Negative points - old 757 in both directions with fairly uncomfortable seats and limited legroom highly limited entertainment on small drop-down screens (e.g.dated film dubbed into Russian) and juddering audio channels food in generous quantities but mediocre tepid and tasteless tea some cabin crew rude and sighed heavily at minor requests from passengers or barked one word instructions random/unfair means of allocating front row seats once on board. One highlight is the bizarre video (played three times to cover Uzbek Russian and English) illustrating that passengers are prohibited from drinking duty free spirits fighting smoking playing with safety equipment or stealing airline property! In summary the airline does OK given their ageing fleet and the country's limited exposure to non-CIS countries. I would not actively choose this airline - especially for any connecting route on to India/Korea - but it was an acceptable means of getting to and from Tashkent.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,,1.0,,2.0,no
21587,Uzbekistan Airways,8,Uzbekistan Airways customer review,1st October 2014,False,Tashkent-Urgench September 2014. Very positive experience especially compared to experience on long haul services. Plane almost new with great legroom; departure on time; pleasant crew. This route probably prioritised to impress tourists but hopefully the airline will upgrade the rest of its fleet to the same standard and ensure all staff this well trained and pleasant to passengers. This means I could recommend HY for domestic services which use new Airbus aircraft.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,2.0,,1.0,,4.0,yes
21588,Uzbekistan Airways,8,Uzbekistan Airways customer review,8th April 2014,False,This airline is what most people say: it takes you from A to B. Don't expect anything more. I traveled from SHJ to TAS first class as there was no available seat in economy. Seats are old fashioned not flatbed but comfortable. Flight was 3.5 hours. Food was good and service was also good. Return was TAS to DXB economy. Seats were good typical for economy. Ticket is expensive (around 1100 US$ economy return) considering fight duration but I guess because it is the only airliner which operates direct flight from UAE to Uzbekistan.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,,1.0,,1.0,yes

An untrained person was issuing boarding passes on check-in counter at IGIA taking ages for a routine task and asking his colleague for each and everything he was supposed to do. Flight from New Delhi to Tashkent (HY 422) was satisfactory. Extremely slow (waited for almost 2 hours in queue) check-in at Tashkent Airport. Check-in staff were talking on mobile phone while people were waiting in queue. In flight from Tashkent to LHR (HY 201 duration 8 hours) no vegetarian food was available. Food quality was very bad.

21595,Uzbekistan Airways,7,Uzbekistan Airways customer review,10th January 2013,False,TAS-UGC (Urgench) domestic flight on an almost new A320. Everything clean and ok in the front cabin. Flight was fully booked but all procedures at the airport started early so boarding and take off were early too. In the front cabin they had a kind of welcome drink (non-alcoholic) before takeoff and coffee/tea during the flight of 75 minutes. No meal available but this was the only reason for criticism the other marks for Uzbekistan Airlines are (surprisingly) high. Good plane safe procedures (although time consuming at the airport) excellent on time performance - good value for money.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,2.0,,0.0,,4.0,yes
21596,Uzbekistan Airways,5,Uzbekistan Airways customer review,22nd November 2012,False,I traveled Kuala Lumpur to Almaty on 24 Oct. For the transit at Tashkent I requested for wheelchair assistant as I had a surgery and was unable to walk long distant nor carry my laptop bag. The airline didn't provide the service when I was at Tashkent boarding the plane to Almaty. When I requested for the service the staff instead asked a passenger flying to Almaty to carry my bag (he had to carry his own laptop bag as well) and I need to walk at the new terminal. I'm very disappointed with the service of the airline.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,3.0,,1.0,,3.0,no
21597,Uzbekistan Airways,8,Uzbekistan Airways customer review,22nd October 2012,False,I flew to Tashkent on 5 October return on 12 October. Flights both ways were excellent. Boeing 757 on the way out and Boeing 767 on return. Planes were clean the flight crew helpful and friendly. Neither flight was full to capacity and thus I was able to have the entire seating row to myself each way. Was served dinner on both flights they were substantial and satisfying nice warm blankets were also on the seats on boarding. Both flights took off and landed at time. My only criticism is that the inflight entertainment was in Uzbek/Russian even though the films being shown were English/American. I would recommend this airline.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,,3.0,,4.0,yes
21598,Uzbekistan Airways,2,Uzbekistan Airways customer review,9th October 2012,False,BKK-TAS. Plane interior was yellow with age and quite filthy Toilet paper on the floor and a garbage bag just behind a passenger seat. I was horrified at the conditions. The food was decent but there not much inflight entertainment to speak of - in fact the screens on the left side of the plane weren't working.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,3.0,,1.0,,2.0,no

Low cost airline means low maintenance in the planes the seats were coming apart the inflight entertainment was only in Uzbek (or Russian). We didn't try their food but the special meals we ordered were awful. Out of the 8 legs only one (the last thankfully) did we feel unsafe and that was because of turbulence. We flew high season and paid about 40% of the regular fare so cannot complain. I would not fly with them if the difference in price was not so huge.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes
21600,Uzbekistan Airways,8,Uzbekistan Airways customer review,28th March 2010,False,Delhi-Tashkent-LHR - flew first class as was half the price of usual business class DEL to LHR. Had first class to myself. Old style reclining sprung seats in 767 - reasonable room but not lie flat. No power at seat so laptop ran out of battery which is a shame because in flight entertainment is a couple of poor films on overhead screen. Flight staff excellent even encouraging a visit to Uzbekhistan and showing the best tourist sites. Plenty of food and drinks on tap. Everything to time. Rather bizarrely the only delay was at Terminal Four when had to wait on the air-bridge for 30 minutes until someone opened the door! Overall felt budget compared with traditional carriers but very comfortable which is what I paid for.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes
21601,Uzbekistan Airways,5,Uzbekistan Airways customer review,22nd March 2010,False,Tashkent to Nukus (domestic) - was scared to board the old TU 154. Seemed to be patched up on the outside no one seems to acknowledge seat allocation and I think I caused an onboard fight by making this woman move from my seat who yelled at me and then the woman in her seat who took it out on the person in her seat and so on. But they did move. Wasn't that cheap considering the plane we were in. Couldn't relax until we arrived. Had some peanuts and flavoured water served to us. Seats folded down forwards when we got off the plane. Security guards in the baggage collection area checking our tickets when we collected our bags. Still it beats the 14 hours train ride when you're on a tight schedule.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1.0,no
21602,Uzbekistan Airways,8,Uzbekistan Airways customer review,26th February 2010,False,Bangkok-Tashkent-Bishkek. Flight attendants great. An older plane but was comfortable in Business Class with no other passengers.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes
21603,Uzbekistan Airways,3,Uzbekistan Airways customer review,23rd February 2010,False,Lahore - Tashkent - Frankfurt in Business. First of all I'd like to acknowledge the work of the flight attendants. They do an excellent job friendly and quite service minded despite the dated equipment. Lahore - Tashkent food is - well that is the question. Supposedly chicken but it could have been anything. Tea was served in a plastic cup with broken ear. But with a smile. Some sort of business-class package given with slippers and sleeping mask. Tashkent - Frankfurt service fine only overhead IFE. I managed to fold down my chair to almost lie-flat - before realising it was because it was broken. My fellow passenger behind me protested with a moan (I would have been louder actually). Planes are old. They were nice 18 years ago when UA started their service. Nowadays it's not so good. But they get the job done. In conclusion it's fortunate I didn't have to pay these tickets out of my own pocket.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,,1.0,no
21604,Uzbekistan Airways,6,Uzbekistan Airways customer review,10th November 2009,False,"If you book your flight in Tashkent you get what you pay for - basic service that will get you from A to B with no frills. However if you book your flight outside of Uzbekistan the flight prices are ridiculous. I regularly fly LHR-TAS-LHR. If I have my ticket booked in Tashkent it costs approx $350 return - if booked in London costs me about £550 from the airline. I take great issue with the check in at Heathrow. There are 3 check in desks to check in about 300 people. Many of those 300 speak little or no English which makes the process more prolonged and agonising. There is a screen that says ""Tashkent- Business class check in"". This isn't used for Business class only and even those paying a premium price can expect to wait up to 2 hours to check in. Boarding is as expected - everyone pushes but my experience has been that everyone sits in their allocated seats. Inflight entertainment is poor seats are comfortable and cleanliness is acceptable. Staff vary from helpful to uncooperative. A bribe can be paid ($50-$100) to cabin crew to sit in business class.",,,Business Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes
21605,Uzbekistan Airways,n,Uzbekistan Airways customer review,5th November 2009,False,"Tashkent - Istanbul - Tashkent. Outbound flight went to plan - satisfactory and no more: a small miracle for this outfit! Then turned up at 12:45 this past Sunday for the return flight only to see nothing listed on the departure board! The Uzbek Air desk at the airport was unmanned and the airport information desk said there was no flight - as printed on my ticket - it did not exist! After wasting the day at the airport turned up at my hotel again and eventually found the city office for the airline on Tuesday - an obscure office tucked away in a dark and dingy building. They photocopied my ticket and said it would be sent to Tashkent for ""investigation."" How much of an investigation is there for a ticket printed for a flight that does not exist? Phoned them back yesterday (Friday) as they had not called me back as promised! I can indeed fly - but for a fee of 25 Euro! In their view it was my error not to turn up to their office on Monday given that I arrived ""late"" on the Tuesday. I had not contacted them ""immediately"". Never mind that nobody was at their airport desk and that airport information tried hard to reach them. Worse the flight that I should have been on - has my ticket been printed correctly- has been cancelled anyway. So either way I would have been inconvenienced!

Check in staff at Heathrow explained as the flight was not full we could have a row to ourselves. Food service okay - lots of it but low quality. Wine was local. Seats okay. IFE very poor.

When checking in at LHR I was informed that the flight would be making an unscheduled stopover at Paris CDG. The rumour had it that it was to pick up the UZB president's daughter. All this meant the flight to TAS would take 9hrs long 2 hrs longer than normal. Some people confirmed such unscheduled stopovers were quite commonplace. I was not impressed. Inflight service is pretty bad. So bad that when you call the stewardess they do not turn up. Even when they turn up they are so unhappy to be serving you so rude it is quite unbelievable. I did not eat the food that was served so can not comment on that. On the way back I paid the head stewardess $100 to sit in business class.

21608,Uzbekistan Airways,3,Uzbekistan Airways customer review,17th September 2009,False,LHR-TAS return and UGC-TAS. International flight operated by B757. Legroom poor by scheduled flight standard more like charter. Plane only half full both ways so room to spread out. Food and drinks service okay. Both flights on time. Internal flight by Ilyshin 114no problems. No food but 2 drinks on 1hr 45min leg. My concern is security at Uzbeck airports - people allowed through security with all manner of liquids sealed and open. Security appears second to form filling and stamping.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
21609,Uzbekistan Airways,4,Uzbekistan Airways customer review,26th July 2009,False,Riga to Tashkent then on to Lahore and back. This airline's routes are excellent. Food excellent with copious amounts. Service fine and nice to get different tasting beers than the usual. FAs fine once they trust you are not going to be another difficult passenger. Uzbekistan Airways suffers from poor ground operations and officialdom at their airports which means that by the time people board the craft they are not always at their best. This is taxing on cabin crew who respond with professionalism even if they are not the greatest smilers. I understand Uzbekistan Airways are joining Skyteam. They are easily in the class of some other members of Skyteam now so hopefully this will mean more good connections in an area of the world they serve well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
21610,Uzbekistan Airways,2,Uzbekistan Airways customer review,23rd June 2009,False,Two stars is an average of 3 stars for international a 1 star for national flights. I experienced Frankfurt-Tashkent-Frankfurt Tashkent-Chiva-Tashkent and Tashkent-Bukhara- Tashkent. Airplanes on international flights are mainly Boeings 757 quite new ones national manly Tupolevs 155M probably from 80´s. Space in planes is comparable to any other airlines service is quite pure. Local people do not look for right seats very carefully so the staff ask you to sit anywhere at the end of boarding. You also have to know that there are two separate buildings at the airport – national and international. The business lounge at Tashkent airport has improved a lot – if you travel in business or with gold cards look for business check-in counter which is located in the corridor next to main hall.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
21611,Uzbekistan Airways,3,Uzbekistan Airways customer review,31st December 2008,False,Took two flights with this outfit a return TAS-ALA-TAS. The outbound flight went well booked it online via Opodo and was given an E-ticket. The aircraft was a Boeing 757. The return was a different matter and it all went wrong from here! I was not able to get the return flight I wanted but was advised to go to the airport in Almaty before the flight as they usually hold a couple of seats for every plane. My girlfriend is Russian and spoke to the staff on our behalf. We were informed that we could have two seats - but we would have to pay a bribe on top on the standard seat charges! I took exception at first but then worked out that it would be cheaper than paying an additional day for accommodation. However it then transpired that the staff were in-fact refusing seats to another couple telling them that check-in had closed for them when in reality there was 30 minutes left for check-in. Clearly they were being denied boarding so that the airline staff could collect my bribe! I felt terrible but did not have to cancel my deal with the staff as the couple being denied boarding work out that they would need to bribe the staff too! They did so and where allowed to proceed to check-in my girlfriend was then told the seats were not available after-all! She also informed me that they ground staff were really very rude indeed to this couple having threatened them with “trouble” if they complained about the flight being closed early! We went to a travel agent and book a normal ticket on a later flight without any bribes! That flight to Tashkent was then not on a nice 757 but on a Russian Tupolev 155 aircraft. While it is quite special in a way to have the full Soviet Union flying experience it is not comfortable quite or smooth! With no turbulence this thing rockets up and down like a fighter jet; the noise is such that you may as well be sitting on the wing! While we took off on-time we were met with fog in Tashkent and diverted to Sarmankand only landing in Tashkent some hours late. As such I missed my Aeroflot connection to Moscow and spent hours killing time in the airport. The funny thing was the only bar in the departure lounge does not take the national currency – just Russian Rubles and dollars! The cherry on the cake was again the ground staff coming back for bribes! I was well overweight for my Moscow connecting Aeroflot flight but $50.00 was exchanged and the matter resolved! In London the extra weight had cost me $300 which Aeroflot lost on my return thanks to the Uzbek business culture. Corruption has two sides it can be very disruptive and also very convenient but on the whole I can do without it in future.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
21612,Uzbekistan Airways,3,Uzbekistan Airways customer review,1st July 2008,False,TAS-FRA surprisingly was on time. Old A-310 was put for this flight with old seats and poor entertainment. Entertainment always a lack of Uzbekistan Service. Crew was ok they were friendly enough but nothing extraordinary. For money they charge Uzbekistan Airways can be bit more concerned about their services.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
21613,Uzbekistan Airways,3,Uzbekistan Airways customer review,29th April 2008,False,London to Tashkent and back. Once again the inflight experience was OK. Flights were on time both ways despite the usual Heathrow problems. The aircraft interiors are getting a little scruffy especially the seats. They have upgraded the IFE to a DVD system. According to their magazine they have ordered 2 Dreamliners and 6 A320's so things could improve after a couple of years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
21614,Uzbekistan Airways,2,Uzbekistan Airways customer review,24th January 2008,False,Tashkent-Urgench-Tashkent. Staff try to get your money for everything even if most of them knows me personally after 5 years of same destination - extra baggage better seat etc. When you want to reserve a seat mostly you'll get a negative answer first. They will tell you that flight is full. What they do is reserve some seats for artificial names. That way the flight seems full when you attempt a reservation. If you pay an under-the-counter fee she will change the name on the reservation on your name and you got your seat. Same during check-in : they will ask you to put your hand bag/computer/whatever on to the scale. If you are somehow +20 they will start to make faces and convince you that it will be too expensive if you pay official fee. They will ask you to pay half of the money that you'll pay officially directly to check in staff. I don't do that now as the official fee is also is not that much. I simply ask them to write the extra weight which I check each time and go to pay to the counter. The officer in the counter is also surprised as this is not very common. If you'll ask for a specific seat they will make you understand that it is available against a small tip (2-3 USD). Don't as usually no one sits in accordance with the assigned seats and it is almost impossible to convince the person who have sit to your place to move. In the past you might also tip (20-50 USD) in the cabin and ask for a Business Class seat but I do not know if this is still possible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
21615,Uzbekistan Airways,3,Uzbekistan Airways customer review,17th September 2007,False,I have flown Uzbek air extensively including international regional and domestic flights. They are not a great airline by world standards but are great by regional standards. That said if you want to fly to Uzbekistan or fly within Uzbekistan you probably won’t have much of a choice but to fly Uzbek Air. If Uzbekistan is not a destination then they are probably overpriced for the service and I would use another carrier unless your schedule requires a transit though Tashkent. For international I would give them a 3 star overall and a 2 star for domestic flights.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
21616,Uzbekistan Airways,3,Uzbekistan Airways customer review,10th September 2007,False,ATH-TAS return. Both flights on time. The personnel were friendly enough and eager to help you. The food was good only food presentation and trays were standard. There were two servings of drinks on each flight. The only complaint - inflight entertainment system was outdated (overhead screens with two outdated movies and some channels with music). The planes were old but clean. Overall a good experience with no troubles.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
21617,Uzbekistan Airways,2,Uzbekistan Airways customer review,22nd August 2007,False,LHR-TAS. My experience with this airline has been OK. They seem to keep to the flight times reasonably well at least out of Tashkent. There are some problems with the cabin crew - using mobile phones during take off being one example. A real issue I have with them is the chaotic check in at LHR. The last two times at LHR the queue has filled one end of terminal 2 and takes 2-3 hours to get through. The flight is typically delayed by an hour because of this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
21618,V Air,1,"""spotless, efficient, thoughtful""",9th July 2016,False,"  I was really impressed with V Air flying from Bangkok to Taipei. Easy to use website for booking. Smiling staff at check in. Very efficient, even weighed and tagged cabin baggage. Flight lifted off at exact departure time. Plane seemed new. We didn't pre-order food but were able to buy some. Cabin crew did a delightful safety demonstration, smiling graciously and the passengers applauded. Everything spotless, efficient, thoughtful.

I was informed two days before the flight, that my flight time would be changed from 12:30 to 20.15. I got to the airport, two hours before the flight time, and it took an hour to check in. The queue was horrendous. At check in we were informed there were no delays. When we got to the gate, there was no plane. Departure time came and went without any announcements. The plane arrived at about 20:45. We didn't leave until 21:30. We didn't arrive in Taipei until after midnight. I could have gone on Jetstar for the same price at this time. The crew were very apologetic for the delay and quite fun.

The flight was scheduled to leave at approximately 1:30AM. For some reason the flight was delayed for well over 2 hours. Not much of an explanation was provided. Due to the flight delay our group missed their connecting flight in Taipei. Had the flight left on time we had 4 hours to make our connecting flight. With the extensive flight delay we were unable to make that connection. The V Air staff were not very helpful at all in trying to contact our connecting flight airline to see how we might be able to make our connection. Their customer service response to a request for an explanation on what happened and why more assistance wasn't provided was useless. I have pasted their response below ""Dear Tim, According to our policy, V-air has no compensation for flight delay less than 4 hours. Apologize for any inconvenience caused.

I arrived at the newly opened international terminal at Bangkok's Don Mueang airport about 90 minutes prior to the scheduled departure. Check-in took less than 5 minutes even though the plane was around 85% full. The aircraft pushed back 35 minutes late but arrived precisely on time. The seat is comfortable with more leg space than is usual on budget carriers, my pre-ordered meal of chicken teriyaki was excellent and the FAs are efficient and cheerful. One even came to my seat to welcome me back having seen me on my last flight almost 5 months earlier!

21623,V Air,8,V Air customer review,16th August 2015,False,"I have taken 3 flights on V Air and found it a surprisingly pleasant experience. The aircraft seemed new, the FAs were very efficient and the meals (pre-booked at a discount) tasty. On the latest TPE/CNX flight I measured the seat pitch at 32"". If this is accurate, then it puts many of the long distance flights on legacy carriers to shame. The first flight in May was held up an hour at TPE due to runway maintenance. The other two this month both departed within 10 minutes of the advertised schedule. It's about time there were low cost carriers between BKK and TPE.

21624,V Air,1,V Air customer review,9th August 2015,False,"V Air is a new budget airline in Taiwan, owned by TransAsia airlines.  I had a ticket from Taipei to Bangkok. However, there was a typhoon that was predicted to arrive. I called V Air call center to ask about the possibility of cancellation and they assured me that the typhoon would pass before my flight and I would be able to board and that they would not change my ticket. However, the flight ended up being cancelled 4 hours before departure anyways. I received a cancellation notice via e-mail nearly 6 hours after the flight was supposed to depart. V Air then pulled the plug on their call center and any calls into the call center received a message in Chinese and were summarily disconnected. They then posted an updated schedule on their website that indicated that my flight was rescheduled for the next day. I arrived at the airport and tried to check in, but they said that my reservation was cancelled and that they would contact the customer service to see if my flight would be rebooked. The staff had no idea what was going on and gave us tons of conflicting information. Then they gave a trainee the responsibility to deal with the group of increasingly angry and upset passengers. And this went on for a couple more hours, but you get the idea. Ultimately, we were rebooked on another V Air flight a few days later and provided zero compensation. To sum up, this is the worst traveling experience I've ever had.  Avoid this airline at all costs.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Taipei to Bangkok,August 2015,1.0,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,no

After waiting in line for 30 minutes to inquire about the mistake, the staff attempted to force me to pay a ¥2,000 counter fee in addition to a credit card fee and an additional seat fee. I nearly missed my flight because of the staff dragging their feet and refusing to fix the problem.

I do not mind having to pay for food and beverages and I do not care about the lack of entertainment. Yet, the seats are hard as rock which makes me feel like I am sitting on a wooden plank. The seat pitch is completely ridiculous that I cannot even tie my shoelaces (My height ~1.65M).

One thing we noticed was that there is only a few counters (we counted around 8) for check in for all domestic flights by Vanilla Air. Due to the limited counters, there are set check in times for different flights. Since our flight was at 10.25 am departure, we are strictly only allowed to check in at 8.55.

No entertainment systems available but not an issue as I usually travel with my iPod and something to read anyway. Flight was calm and we experienced no turbulence en route. You need to purchase on board food or bring something with you but we knew this in advance so brought some food bought at Narita departures terminal.

21651,Vietnam Airlines,1,"""Most terrible experience ever""",1st July 2023,True," Most terrible experience ever. The flight from Sydney to Paris involved two changes in Vietnam (via Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi). Two really bad things happened: 1) Suitcase lost (possibly in Vietnam) and there is absolutely no easy way to communicate with anyone to help you find it. I filed a report in Paris and received a reference number to track it through the worldtracer system. I arrived in Paris on the 17th of June and the good news was that the system showed the suitcase was found in Vietnam and was about to arrive in Paris on the 20th. It must have arrived in Paris but there seems to be no system at the airport to receive it? I was leaving Paris on the 23rd to other parts of Europe. It is now the 1st of July and no signs of the suitcase. After 100s of phone calls to phones that nobody picks up and many emails (a great way to spend your holiday), I got hold of the lost and found department of Vietnam Airlines who seem to know more or less of what I know through the worldtracer system. They can at least do some of the chasing and seem more effective than I on providing updates. I only got hold of these people after contacting the headquarters online email of Vietnam Airlines ([email protected]). The initial response from that email address was useless too because they recommended me checking their website which I of course already had done. In summary, I had to keep writing the same thing many times until I started talking to the lost and found people in France. I of course had to buy these days many clothes and other essential survival items. The lost and found person voluntarily offered 80 USD for compensation which I declined because by the time someone deposits this amount in my bank account, the bank will take most of it in fees. To cut a long story short: avoid it, especially if you have a trip with connection flights and their customer support is close to zero. 2) While leaving from Sydney, half of the plane (essentially everyone heading somewhere else other than Vietnam) was told that because we have to walk to a different terminal in Ho Chi Minh City, we will need a Visa. Yes, it was our responsibility to know that, but nobody knew and nobody would have bought that ticket if they knew. Emergency Visa was offered from the flightcentre at the airport...$500 Australian Dollars per person and overcrowded. I paid for 3 but because the 4th person of my family was Chinese, there was no option for emergency visa so we had to buy a new ticket for that person ($3300 Australian Dollars). Perhaps someone will read this post and avoid these costs in the future. The last, minor issue, was that we had to pick up the luggage at Ho Chi Minh City and check them back in for the connection flight. They were not transferred within the airport. Lesson learnt.

Free terminal bus at Noi Bay airport is very convenient. Check-in easy and superfast for Skypriority card holders, they gave me a spacious seat. Lounge access is not granted to VNs domestic routes unless if arrived on international Skyteam, flight, preferably VN. Paid 20 USD for access to Lotus Lounge which is impressive, large, well-stocked, and truly worth it. Onboard, I got just water and a tissue. However, they have started to push a trolley around for small, additional catering sales. Did not observe in time and lost my chance. Flight almost on time; luggage was present at arrival. Surprised there was an airbridge, then came the big surprise to my day: went into a completely new, stunning, modern airport in Hue. This shocked me completely; it was not there half year ago. Stable, old-fashioned airline, punctual, and good in communication. Generous with luggage. Miles given quickly.

Our final flight which was scheduled to get a connecting flight back to Australia was changed with less than 24 hours notice and put us at risk of being unable to get home. Customer service was impossible to reach on the phone and took hours to respond to multiple emails and Facebook messages ruining the last day of our trip. When we went to check in on this final flight we were told by the staff that we were not in their system even though we had an email confirmation, had chosen seats and had ticket numbers allocated to us in the app. I had to literally cry and beg so that the staff would acknowledge their mistake so that they would issue us with tickets for the flight we needed to be on to get home.

Upon reach check in counter only that we found VN6854 flight cancel, we are very confuse and upset how come Vietnam Airline never inform us in advance at all. Upon calling Vietnam Airline Ho Chi Minh customer service hotline (vietnam airline do not have singapore customer service hotline) only we found out they change our flight to 27/5/2023 6:25pm VN654. Because the newly assign flight 7.5hour delay as per our original plan, we request to change flight to earlier flight because we are rushing back to Ho Chi Minh celebrate my father in law birthday. Total I made 7 call to vietnam airline customer just to check can me and my wife change to earlier flight, my calling cost to them definitely more than SGD$150. After so many call they inform us cannot change. Conclusion 1) They never apologise 2) They sent email inform me about the original flight cancel on 27/5/2023 8:24am 3) they never compensate for the mistake they make 4) me and my wife miss father in law birthday 5) Total we wait at Changi airport T4 more than 11 Hour, that super long day and tired.

SKYTEAM privileges were granted in full despite the ticket was shamelessly cheap. Thus, VN overrules competitors on this route, even my favourite well-pampering local airline Bangkok Airways which in this case lose out to VN on price, lounge, and luggage allowance. The LCC carriers are a no go on this route as they end up expensive and/or unreliable. Worse is that they don’t provide any luggage transfer in Bangkok, forcing pax to go landside and check it in again. Vietnam Airlines have almost never any delay nor cancellation on this route. Check in could not transfer my luggage to final destination, though at least to next destination (Doha with QR). Da Nang International (T2) is dominated by SE-Asian tourists and a lot number of small airlines. Larger aircrafts cant enter the airport as it is in the middle of the city. The Airport is completely renovated and a pleasure. Check-In fast and easy I was treated with a lot of respect due to SKYTEAM status, despite I was travelling on cheapest ticket possible. I could get my 23x2 kg checked it without any questions and I also had two hand-luggages. The Lotus Lounge, that Skyteam-airlines use, is extremely nice and well maintained; it is a huge, unexpected gem find in a small airport. The Lounge has very good food offerings; cold delicatesses, and at least 7 hot meals in buffet. Drink options are a bit below average and only cheaper, local products (2 cheap wines and 4 beer brands, all alike) are offered. Background music appreciated. The décor is of high standard; even smoking and business rooms exist. The lounge appears underutilised, I found only 5-10 other visitors during the 3 hours I spent there. The flight itself was stable and regular. Crew were courteous; food modest only a sandwich tray and drinks were offered. Without requesting it, I was given a seat in the first row after business class – that granted me wide leg space. Luggage transferred correctly as promised and tagged.

Call center and website deficiencies need work, however it redeems itself in the air. My first interaction for this trip which was the website to manage my booking to select my seat and special meal request did not work as it was a Delta ticket using miles, so I did not get the best first impression. Subsequently, I called the call center in Vietnam to order my special meal and was informed that no meals were provided for both legs of my flight. Fast forward to the flight, meals were served on both legs which left me vexed by the misinformation. Airport experience was standard, but the employees didn’t seem too well versed on the procedures as important ones such as making a boarding announcement and reassigning seats after ticket issuance seemed unfamiliar to the staff. I also did not enjoy the double security I had to undergo since my itinerary had a connecting flight and needed to swap terminals when transiting in Hanoi. On the flipside, the airline got some things right. Albeit being unable to order a special meal, the standard ones served were fantastic! There was even bubble tea sold for a modest $2 USD! The inflight crew did a fine job, not exceeding nor falling below expectations on this red eye flight and the entertainment had some good choices.

On my flight to Paris from Sydney through Ho Chi Minh, I didn't need it. And that flight, layover and all was extremely pleasant. Many family, colleagues & friends (even those who are Vietnamese), recommended not using them. And initially I thought they were incorrect, that I had a nice flight to Europe with them. I arrived at Paris CDG Airport to fly home 4 hours before my flight, but when I attempted to check-in I was asked for my transit visa. I didn't even apply for one, no one, neither the airline or my booking agent (Flight Network) informed me I needed one. My searches on Google weeks prior didn't inform me I needed one. I was on the phone to the Australian Embassy, DFAT, my travel insurance, no one could help me without 2 days notice to process my application. I was stranded 4 days before my brother's wedding. I called Vietnam Airlines, they wouldn't answer my call, after 10 minutes on hold, the call was automatically disconnected, the check-in staff couldn't help me. I couldn't even attempt to rebook my flight to a later date. They simply told me, it was my booking agent's fault not theirs. No refund, no credit, no rebooking. No one here showed any accountability or empathy. My first time solo travelling, it was midnight at home, no one could help me. I've never felt so abandoned and helpless. My travel insurance couldn't even confirm if they would cover this issue. The cheapest flight home that day cost me AU$4,200 and was horrible.

Very poor quality of food, I had no choice of food, they only gave me 1 small bottle of water for the whole flight. They never come to ask if you need anything to drink. The seats where very poor quality.  Staff not so friendly, probably due to high work pressure. For the domestic flights there were 2 delays out of my 3 flights a flight of nearly 2 hours HCMC- HAN delayed for 2 hours for a flight that takes only 2 hours. Very poor communication. I will never take this airline again for long distance flights. They say they want to achieve the 5 star rating. But In my opinion they not worth the 4 star.  Transfer in domestic airport very poorly organized. I travel with only hand luggage and online check in, still was forced to check in at the counter. Hanoi international departure was horrible.

I did and suggested an easy alternative (depart SYD 2 days later instead of adding a 24h layover in Hanoi). They finally responded by email - and didn’t give me what I wanted. Instead, they intentionally added 24h layover. At Sydney airport, staff were not able to change this, not able to check my luggage through, not willing to upgrade me, not prepared to provide any information about what I would do in HAN for 24h or where I would be staying. Upon arrival in HAN, me and 7 other premium economy / economy passengers were made to wait for 2 hours before we were escorted to the WORST AND OLDEST hotel ever, Hotel Victory in Hanoi. That’s when the worst thing happened: We did not get individual rooms but were told to SHARE A ROOM WITH A COMPLETE STRANGER.

Check-in in Bangkok not very professional (could not communicate well, did not know African cities, could not retrieve info of my luggage from previous flights). However, in the end I got my business class privileges incl. fast track for security and enjoyed the Miracle, which is a 3rd party, quite disappointing lounge. Lounge provided in SGN (domestic) was the Le Saigonnais, which had good food and (only) soft drinks. Luggage arrived perfectly on both destinations; had to collect it and check it in again in Saigon due to the international arrival from Bangkok to the domestic next flight. On board I found a traditional, ample business class seating. FA-staff were courteous, caring, and very attentive. On both flights I had amble space with pleasant, wide, large seats in a 2 x 2 configuration (4 rows); less than half of the 16 seats were taken. Wet towels provided, likewise welcome drinks. As for food, I got the verbal choice (no menu) of hot and cold snacks and drinks, appropriate for short flights. Asked on both flights if I cared for more food and drinks. Table cloth, steel cutlery and proper glasses were provided. Champagne is not any longer served on regional flights, only wine. The white wine was completely undrinkable: a cheap French sauvignon which is unsellable in Europe, but VN seems pleased to have made a good deal by paying for garbage, feeding their passengers with substandard (toxic?) drinks. 2-4 Vietnamese beers were offered, also on the domestic leg.

21679,Vietnam Airlines,8,"""All journeys were consistently good""",9th December 2022,True,"  I flew five journeys with Vietnam Airlines over a period of three weeks, visiting Vietnam from the UK: two international flights (UK - Vietnam & return) and three domestic within Vietnam. All journeys were consistently good, with some features excellent. I booked direct with the company and got a competitive deal, cash sale no points used. Booking process fine, only issue was a necessary & understandable re routing to avoid Russia/Ukraine/Afghanistan airspace which meant a change to connecting domestic flight times. I was given a week's notice of this but had to call their customer service in Vietnam from the UK to rearrange, which was handled well but was an expensive international call. Airport check in all very good, Premium Economy has fast track check in with this airline, with staff polite and eager to help even coming through to security to find me and alter a very minor detail. Any inconvenience was created by official & tedious Vietnamese bureaucracy at their airports rather than the airline itself, with countless levels of repeated and unnecessary security checks by disinterested and brusk stuffed uniforms. Premium Economy seat comfort excellent: room to stretch out even for me at 6ft1in, enough width for proper personal space and a massive recline with leg rest. Not so good the headphones, not noise cancelling and pretty useless, I have poor hearing and even on max volume the surrounding aircraft noise was louder than the entertainment channels, making its use impossible. Also the cabin upholstery and fittings looked slightly worn & tired, with some people's seat features not working; I think a mild re-fit is needed. Food & drink (for an Economy + cabin) was very good, with pre flight juice offered, a prompt towels, drinks & snack service once in the air and a very good main meal served shortly afterwards. A second hot meal served before landing. Crew were ultra professional, friendly and attentive for the whole flight; continually visible & coming through to offer drinks and quick to respond to requests. I woke at one point to find a bottle of water had been left for me in my seat pocket by the crew whilst I was sleeping; I would say the crew were an outstanding feature of a generally very good performance throughout. Comparing the international & domestic flights over this tour, the service on the international legs was noticeably more polished than on the domestic routes not that they were bad at all. Take offs were all quite prompt, the worst one delayed by 40 minutes and two of the five pushing back right on the stroke of the scheduled time. Overall a very solid performance throughout, with airport & flight crew service and seat comfort scoring very highly indeed.

From other reviews I am seeing online, it also looks like it is a common practice for this company. I booked a flight Tokyo - Hanoi - Paris. For my return (Paris > Hanoi > Tokyo - 18hours), they changed the Hanoi - Tokyo flight to 24 hours later. It appears normal for Vietnam Airlines to let me wait at the airport for that time. No explanations were made, nor any efforts to provide accommodation or any commercial gesture when I reached out to them. Their response? ""Dear Mr. We regret to inform you that due to Vietnam Airlines has informed you about schedule change before departure date so we won't compensate in this case."" When asking if they can assign me a seat with more legroom in the new flight they assigned me? ""We regret to inform that the extra legroom seat applies the fee so we can't support to assign for you via the email. Please kindly access our website Manager booking add ancillaries; seat selection to buy the seat"" When I tried to actually pay to upgrade to premium economy on my longer flight from Paris to Hanoi? ""Because your itinerary has a combination of prices between the 2 itineraries so you cannot upgrade for only flight Paris to HaNoi. If you want to upgrade, you need to upgrade all flights Paris - Ha Noi - Narita to Business class due to flight Ha Noi - Narita don't have premium eco."" At the bare minimum, they did not even offer to pay for a hotel room to avoid me spending one full day waiting at the airport. When trying to find another flight for this connection Hanoi-Tokyo, they suggested to take another flight to Ho Chi Minh, and then to Tokyo. Which would save about 6 hours. What they did not mention or check, is that there was a flight from Hanoi to Tokyo which arrived in Tokyo at the exact same time than what they were suggesting, thus saving this unnecessary additional flight. In short, if you use Vietnam Airlines, be prepared to be left figuring things out on your own when they unilaterally change things. Their best response will be that they covered themselves because they warned you enough time in advance, and if you need to make adjustments, pay for it yourself.

That stated a chain reaction that culminated in missing our connecting flight to Da Nang. The re-scheduled flight was also late amounting to 3 hours overall late. The Premium economy seat was was okay to start with but became more uncomfortable as the journey progressed. The foot rest would not stay up and so I had to wedge my shoe under it to keep it from falling onto my ankle. The recline was difficult to use and I found others struggling to get it to move. The earphones were terrible. The movie selection was also terrible and very limited. There was nothing I wanted to watch. The food was also a bit disappointment given Vietnams reputation for food. As I am into wine again a big let down, there was only one white and one red and of very dubious quality. The crew were good. All of these issues are easily solvable, it appears cost cutting and some poor management decisions have culminated at the customer end.

Took hours to check all passengers in at Sydney Airport. No one was notified about a priority line for those who had already done online check-in, nor was there signage. We were told by the employee checking us in that we should have waited in that line. She was not a VN Airlines employee. For the whole flight, most people's in-flight entertainment was not working at all, or otherwise malfunctioning to the point that it could not be used. Staff were not able to offer an explanation other than to reset the screens over and over again - no apology or acknowledgment given. (This was also the same experience on my return flight, 7 days later). Leg room is reasonable for economy, but the seating was hard and uncomfortable. Webbing behind the seats that holds things is extremely tight and cannot fit anymore stuff in there - so the extras they give like a bag with slippers, blanket, pillow, bottle of water etc. you just have to figure out where to place.

21687,Vietnam Airlines,2,"""No flight, no money returned""",5th August 2022,True,"  No flight, no money returned. COVID-19 brought passengers and airlines across the world to a standstill. While some airlines try to mitigate the situation for their passengers, Vietnam Airlines certainly didn't. My flight to Ho Chi Minh City on 30 Jun 2020 was canceled, and I was given two options. I could either take my money back or take a voucher from VN Airlines for 15% more. I chose the second option, as I'm sure I want to go back home with my partner (non-Viet) and I want to go with Vietnam Airlines. These couple of vouchers had an expiry duration of one year. Unfortunately, by the time they expired, the Vietnamese government still hadn't opened their border. We weren't given instructions on how to claim our money back, they simply told us that we're ""entitled to a refund"". Fine, we waited. No money came. We checked in with their Facebook online chat, which didn't help. So we thought maybe the vouchers still worked. Fast forward to June of this year. I contacted their Customer Service online, they told me they can't help me fly nor will they give me my money back. The reason: I didn't fill in a form to ask for my money back. How was I supposed to know that, when they didn't tell me the procedure? In the end, I wasted 3000 euro on two Premium Economy tickets.

21689,Vietnam Airlines,8,"""it was a pleasant experience""",18th July 2022,True,"  Melbourne to Frankfurt via Ho Chi Minh and return via Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh (domestic flight). This was a very good fare bought at short notice. The online check-in did not work properly in either direction, but all our airport check-in experiences were friendly and efficient. Boarding was orderly, and the on-board service on all legs was welcoming and courteous. The seat was comfortable with useful storage areas, and the vegetarian food and drink were fine (best vegetarian food was on the leg out of Frankfurt). The various lounges we experienced were good, with the best being at the Hanoi domestic terminal. On the outward journey the transit through Ho Chi Minh was a bit chaotic, as it took a long time for the security officers to come and do the security scans and subsequently lead us to the lounge. The return journey included a domestic leg from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh to pick up the ongoing flight to Melbourne. Our emails to VNA, the Vietnamese consulate and Flight Centre (which sold the ticket) asking about visa requirements went unanswered. After we'd made many attempts to get this information, the VNA office in London finally replied and explained that Australians need a visa to take the domestic flight. My partner obtained an e-visa (as a UK citizen I didn't need one). When we arrived at Hanoi immigration was smooth, and after customs a VNA agent appeared from nowhere to take our luggage and direct us to the domestic terminal. The domestic to international transit in Ho Chi Minh was smooth, apart from immigration taking about 20 minutes to verify the entry visas issued in Hanoi. VNA shows its appreciation to Business Class passengers, with priority screening and boarding lanes that really work, and Business Class buses giving priority when bussing to the terminal is necessary. Overall, despite the transit glitches, it was a pleasant experience and very good value.",Boeing 787,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Melbourne to Frankfurt via Ho Chi Minh,July 2022,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,5.0,yes

Get to the airport in HCMC after my first flight and explain I'd please like to spend the 2.5 hours wait in their lounge as my direct flight from Da Nang was replaced. I was told they don't do a direct flight from Da Nang and the booking confirmation I presented to them was my original booking! At this point there were four members of staff stood opposite me telling me the information I was giving them if incorrect. This obviously wasn't the case, and I showed them my original direct ticket. As SG isn't my final destination, the check in staff asked to see my tickets to my final destination, Thailand, then stated to me that I cannot fly there was I would need to be flying to Bangkok, not Phuket, under current regulations. I was almost laughing out of sheer disbelief, as I've entered Thailand three times already this year, and informed them they are reading out old regulations to me which changed at the start of April. They told me it's likely I'll miss my next flight due to the short changeover time left available to me, and gave me a waiver to sign declaring it's not their fault if I miss the flight - even though they are the reason I now have 45 minutes to exit the plane, clear immigration and check in for my final flight, instead of 90 minutes as per my original booking. I stood for almost 30 minutes at the check in counter in HCMC arguing with their staff about a very simple issue: their changing of my booking will cause me to miss a flight and cause me added expense.

The seats were visibly narrower than the Boeing 787’s reverse herringbone seats. Food was almost inedible but since the Changi Airport Terminal 4 lounge was quite good, we did not mind. Once in Ho Chi Minh City, the 3rd floor lounge was filled to the brim and we were brought to a first floor lounge. Food was below par except for spring rolls. Second sector in Boeing 787’s reverse herringbone 1-2-1 full flat seats (very similar to Finnair’s). Slept OK. All flights were on time and we even arrived in London 45 mins earlier than schedule. On each flight, there was 2-3 very attentive FA with the others being less helpful (more training needed). Did not take the supper but breakfasts was tasty, albeit too small portions.

It was actually a bit scary as the flight information was removed from all the flight screens. Warm beer was served to us! Once we arrived in London, when I got home I found my luggage completely soaked and everything needed to be rewashed and afew items damaged. On my return leg I had a long layover in Hanoi so requested to have my luggage delivered there as I was concerned it would get soaked again. They ended up not being able to find our luggage in Hanoi. After a very nervious and long layover and many many calls throughout the long layover, they found our baggage at the airport. The only reason I am giving them a 2nd point is the service on the plane was acceptable. Apart from that, it was a very stressful voyage.

But my request must have confused the person answering the phone as I was put on hold for 8 minutes. My sim card balance expired. I then tried emailing the airline at 10am. When I returned to Australia I found that the reply had been received at 4.04pm, after I’d packed my laptop into my bag to head to the airport. Six hours for a reply? It told me that there was a problem with the VNA on-line check in. But there was no message on the VNA website to that effect. At the airport I went to Ticketing who told me the flight was almost full. For a special price of only AUD$180 I purchased an upgrade to premium economy. Boarding lounge 27 was full of intending passengers at the boarding time of 7.55 pm for the 8.15 departure and the Boeing 787-9 was waiting at the air bridge. Then at 8.20, ground staff told everyone to move to gate 22. After arriving there, we sat and waited with no explanation forthcoming. 20 minutes later, buses arrived to transport passengers to the aircraft which was parked a considerable distance from the terminal. Still no explanation. On board we saw the safety video with inaudible sound again. In fact, most of the cabin announcements were inaudible. No aircraft movement until 9.38 with take off at 9.47 – 92 minutes late. Still no explanation. The aircraft could not make up such a late departure so our landing slot at SYD was lost. We landed 0906, almost an hour late. Premium economy was good value at the special price. Better meals and service, large, reclining seat, a lot more leg room, but the same In Flight Entertainment which is poor when compared with other airlines.

21739,Vietnam Airlines,2,"""this is the worse airline""",3rd August 2019,True,"  Singapore to Frankfurt via Ho Chi Minh City. This is the worse airline by far that we have flown with. First they sent us a change of flight time 2 days before departure (Singapore - Frankfurt) by 2.5 hours earlier! We do not live in Singapore therefore we naturally had pre-booked weeks before a different flight into Singapore, arriving at approx. 3 hours before our original connecting flight with Vietnam Airlines. The gap then didn't allow for 2.5 hours of flight change time. Trying to contact Vietnam airlines by phone is a futile effort. They are worse if not as bad as bargain airlines where it's impossible to get a hold of anyone by phone. Their automated phone system tells you to press X for English but nothing happens. It goes in a loop in Vietnamese. I then had to be creative and called up Singapore airport and asked to be transferred to Vietnam Airlines check in counter. Still didn't get a hold of anyone. Singapore then suggested I contact them via FB chat. So I did...oh my gosh, let me tell you, if I can gouge my eyes out it would have been less painful. Their English is so poor they cannot understand my concern. They kept insisting (for over an hour) that the flight time didn't change even after I sent them screen shots after screen shots of email confirmation and email notification of change time. Why did you send me a notice of time change of flight if the time didn't change?! But they kept insisting they are right. At the end (after 2.5/3 hours of chatting) they realized they did change the time. And the answer for that was - we are sorry for the inconvenience.  That's it? No offer to cover the cost of our new flight booking in order to connect to their flight, clearly all their fault. Unbelievable! Anyway, as far as business class goes, this airline is poor. The seats, while typical business class cabin, are old, dirty and need new upholstery. There are hardly any nooks and crannies to put away your stuff. Flight attendants are friendly enough but they hardly spoke English. They need to train their staff better if they want to be a global airline. Lounges are sub-par. You get better foods at the restaurants in the airport and seating much cleaner outside the lounges (in Vietnam). Stains on their seats and chairs and tables not cleaned on a timely basis.

21740,Vietnam Airlines,6,"""unsmiling cabin crew""",29th July 2019,False,"  Sydney to Ho Chi Minh City. It seems a shame that Vietnam Airlines continues to shoot itself in the foot, instead of improving. My trip from Sydney to Ho Chi Minh City was afflicted by the same problems as in past 6 years. The safety announcement prior to take off was almost inaudible and beyond comprehension. I brought this to the attention of the senior cabin attendant in economy who didn’t seem concerned. Even the video presentation had errors with the actor in the life-vest demonstration blowing across the inflation tubes, not into them. The food served about an hour after departure was okay, not special. Soon after the trays were cleared away we entered an area of quite strong turbulence. The seat belt sign was illuminated and an almost inaudible message alerted passengers, but then the sign stayed on for almost 3 hours after the turbulence had ceased. Naturally, passengers ignored the sign and went about the cabin and to the toilets with no concern from the cabin attendants. As has been the case for years, the in-flight entertainment leaves a lot to be desired, especially when compared to similar carriers. Choices are extremely limited, while the secondary control on the top of the seat armrest repeatedly changes the volume, turns your reading light on or calls the cabin attendant if your rest your arm on it. A serious design error approved by Vietnam Airlines. The pre-landing snack was a beef pie. Mine was cold, and I asked the senior attendant for a hot one. She said nothing, took the tray and disappeared. Soon after, the food server in the other aisle saw that I had no meal and gave me a hot pie. After another 5 minutes the senior came back with my original pie. Is this the best VNA can do with cabin service? Oh, and like every VNA flight I’ve taken in the past 6 years, the unsmiling cabin crew seem to regard their job as boring and a grudging effort. VNA has the potential to be among the top international carriers in the world, but it will take a total attitude turnaround of senior management to achieve this.",Boeing 787-9,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Ho Chi Minh City,July 2019,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,,3.0,no

Even though it could not be made like a flatbed, it was enough for me to sleep well. Legroom was very very generous, as this should not be a problem for this class. The seat was just 45cm wide, a little bit small. Two meals were served on this 12-hour flight. I chose to have a seafood meal, even though I do not have any problems with any kinds of food. In general, I was satisfied with both the quantity and the quality of the food. The things I love most is the huge diversity of drinks: Lots of soft drinks, juice, milk and even wines were offered. However, extra non-meal food was bad. As stated in the menu, instant noodles and sandwiches could be ordered at all time, but I failed to order sandwiches. As for in-flight entertainment, since I am Vietnamese, I really enjoy their programs, and I found that Vietnam Airlines really try their best to put the newest and hottest movies on their entertainment. However, another issue happened with the headphone. The in-flight headphones were very old, they have been used for quite lots of years. Also, in my seat, the headphone could not be strictly plugged into the socket, which was really annoying. Flight attendants are helpful and friendly, but I found that they were really tired. Announcements were well played, in three languages (Vietnamese, English and French). This time I think that they spoke really well. In general, I think Vietnam Airlines managed to satisfy all the requirements for a long-haul flight. They also succeeded to make it worth paying extra for Premium Economy. However, in order to be 5-star, they need to improve a lot on the facilities, food as well as in-flight entertainment.",A350,Business,Premium Economy,Hanoi to Paris,June 2019,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,4.0,yes

This time, the check-in was very quick since I have Sky Priority pass. However, it took around 30 mins to clear the security check. This flight was delayed for 15 minutes (due to prior late arrival), but the announcement was clear. This did not bring me any troubles, and I have not seen any serious (at least 20 mins) delays from Vietnam Airlines even though SGN is over crowded. The on board services were excellent, Hot meal was offered as the flight was at noon. Attendants were very friendly, I asked for another hot meal and they accepted! Sadly, the public screen was used to show the inflight safety instruction, it would have been better if it shown the position of the aircraft during the whole flight.

When we arrived in Hanoi for our flight home, we were told we had to pay a rerouting fee because we did not take the Saigon to Hanoi flight. We mentioned that we had bought two extra flights with the airline and managed to check in online for our flight back to London with no mention of a fee. The airline staff insisted we had to pay a fee or not fly so we said we’d pay. The rerouting fee was over £200 each! We had no choice but to pay an extra £400+ because we wanted to get home.

I have not flown this airline and after this headache of a process, I never will. It is very inefficient and it wastes time you do not have. In 4/2020 I was supposed to go to Manchester but COVID happened. Virgin did give me a credit which was great. Fast forward to 2022, I wanted to book a flight to Cancun and use my credit. They had no flights and I don't mean like full, I mean none going the week of 6/27 which I found insane and when you try and book online it only allowed you to book with points and not money. In any case, I wanted to get a refund for my ticket and you can't call and speak to anyone you have to fill out a form and wait 48 hours for someone to reach out to you. A  staff member finally text me. He was very nice and he processed my return. One day later, I realized that the card I originally used is cancelled. So I text back at that number and I got an automated message to fill out another form. So I go back and do that and now three days later I get an e-mail from customer service to tell me what happens to the money. So I had one more question for him. I e-mail back and you get another automated message to fill out the form and someone will get to you in 48 hours.

Our flight, booked months ago, was canceled approximately 48 hours in advance. All we received was an email. The links in the email directing you to get a refund or reschedule were broken. The flight status was not even available until about 24 hours in advance. My husband and I both called the recommended phone number and were put on hold for over 2 hours and then hung up on. The next day, we called back and were put in a queue. It took over three hours to get a call back. When we finally talked to a human being, we were re-routed to customer service and then hung up on. Flights have gone up in price since we booked, and they would not give us a refund that would cover the price of a new flight or book us on another flight the same day, which means we will lose money pre-paid on hotels and rental cars at our destination and have to pay out of pocket for the difference in a last-minute flight to get there. They just do not work with you at all or even try to understand your needs or respond to you in a timely manner. I will never be booking with Virgin again, and advise customers to beware — if your flight is cancelled due to the airline itself (where they should really step up to assist you), you may not even receive a full refund and may not reach your destination.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Austin to Kahului via San Francisco,March 2018,,,,1.0,,,1.0,no

Early on in our flight, the captain placed the seatbelt sign on due to turbulence. I needed to use the restroom as I glance back I saw a gentleman standing and waiting near where attendants were sitting in their quarters. They were laughing, giggling and flirting with the passenger as he stood and waited for the restroom to become available. When He went into the restroom, I stood up to wait exactly where he just stood, only to get a very rude toned request to sit while I wait. I asked why that gentlemen wasn’t addressed in the same manner to only have another rude response followed by the two employees speaking poorly of me as I entered the restroom. For the remainder of the flight, the stewardesses treated me very poorly and made me feel extremely uncomfortable with nasty stares. At one point I was watching a movie, and the head stewardess, not having any interaction with me prior, came over in an aggressive manner and waved her hand in front of my face, with no smile asked me if there is a problem here she should be aware of, when I said no, because I was not about to have any further aggressive and rude comments thrown my way, she asked again are you sure, I felt bullied on this flight.

Let’s start on how incredibly rude and unhelpful the agent at the gate was. When asked if she could help with arranging my seat to an aisle seat for the extra cost, she simply said that the aircraft was full, never even looking up at me. Then quickly starts talking to her coworker without letting me get in another word. Once on the plane, I noticed that their was several seats open. I knew that these were not no-shows as the last person who was called for the flight was standing right behind me when boarding. But the bad customer service doesn’t stop there. The flight attendants were even worse. My boyfriend had asked a flight attendant for an item and she responded with a shouting “hold on!” We didn’t understand why she had shouted it since we were simply asking for our order. It wasn’t as if she was helping anyone else at the time. She was currently helping us. The second flight attendant wasn’t any better. Just simply rude in her tone. Seemed as if she was bothered with anyone. To make matters worse my baggage got lost! Since I had a late flight there wasn’t any stores open by the time I left the airport. The baggage was returned within 24 hours however, I picked it up since it was a four hour delay in delivery. This experience was by far the worst I’ve had with any airline and I travel a lot for business. I will no longer recommend Virgin to anyone.

Yesterday when I was checking in for my flight today, I decided to spring for the upgrade to the exit row. I was re-assigned seat 9D. I printed my boarding pass at home. At the gate, the agent took my boarding pass from me and handed me a different one. I didn't notice till I got on the plane that my seat had been switched to a non-exit row 7A. When I brought the discrepancy up to the flight attendant she said I had to go back to the gate agent to rectify the problem. It took a few minutes to swim upstream to get there and by that time the gate agent was coming down the gangway and he refused to help me and told me to take it up with customer service. When I went to the seat on my boarding pass 7A, there was a child sitting in the seat next to his mother who was in the middle seat. When I sat down in the aisle seat, the other passenger asked me to move to another row since there were other seats available. There were two open seats in Row 9 so I went to sit in one of those and the gate agent and flight attendant insisted I could not sit there even though I had paid for the exit row. The gate agent was incredibly nasty and threatened me that if I didn't go sit in the back of the plane he would throw me off the flight. At no time did they ask the woman who put her kid in my seat to either move or let me sit in the aisle seat. As I had an important meeting in Dallas, I did find an open seat in the back of the plane.

However, the car seat was broken when we received it. I called them to locate the missing part so that we could fix it ourselves. People that spoke to were nice but they did not do anything to help me solve the issue but told me to call different departments. Finally I was told to call central baggage which is voicemail only department. Called and left voicemail twice but never got a call back. Our car seat is for our new first baby which is designed for use up to 2 years and we could only use it for 2 months. Another thing is that I wasn’t asking them to pay or compensate, I was just asking to help find and deliver the remaining part to us so we could put the car seat together and fix it ourselves but they never contacted us to give us an answer. The ticket was $350 round trip but our car seat-strolller system cost about the same. It’s even more costly to fly with virgin America.

It was windy that morning and the outside temperature was around -6 below zero. I put on all the layers of clothing I had with me but was still completely frozen. I asked for a blanket or some sort of assistance and the flight attendant just kept saying no ma'am but the repair will be done soon.

Making the reservation ended up in my having to cancel what I had already booked because they wouldn’t let my small dog on that flight. So an agent in Denver assisted me in canceling that one and booking a new one. However he forgot to assign seats. When I discovered this error 2 days before the flight, I was told there were no free seats left and would have to pay $60 for premium seats. I should have fought it because it seemed like an agent error but I paid it. Then we got to the airport and paid another $100 for the bags. So for a short flight, we paid $160 just for seats and bags not including the actual flight which was around $475 including $100 for my dog. I kept getting flight status emails for the canceled flight, nothing on the new flight. Once we arrived at Palm Springs airport, the flight was to board at 4, take off at 4:42. At 4:15 and no plane at the gate, we asked the agent for an update. Then we were told there’s a mechanical problem, no plane will arrive until 5:30, take off around 6:10, an hour and a half past the scheduled time.

Unfortunately, my trip back home was more unsatisfactory. Upon purchasing a small meal pack (I'm guessing the options were limited since it was only a 1.25 hour flight) and a cocktail, we were the last ones served (last seats on the plane). I feel as though delivering purchased products would be more of a priority. Perhaps assigning one person to deliver products while the other offers complimentary drinks would be more effective for customer service and efficiency. Maybe operationally that doesn't work for them because of cost but it compromises service. After receiving our order, the steward forgot an item and when I said excuse me and tried to tell her, she turned and said ""you have to wait"". I completely understand that but the way she said it was in a tone and look that I could only receive as annoyance. It was as if I was a nuisance to her. After reaching the back of the plane, I could hear loudly the other steward complaining and bad mouthing about a gentleman who wanted 2 diet cokes. I understand people talk shop but wow, in ear shot of other guests? We only received our purchases after the plane started to descend and before we knew it, we were forced to give up our purchased wine and cocktail. When my companion said ""I didn't even get to finish. I'm going to get a refund."" The steward retort with a ""you do that"". All I could think, and pardon the language, was ""what the heck?"".

Thank you Virgin America, this worked out perfectly. Re ticketed in minutes, despite traveling on two different records. Given seats together in Main Cabin Select. Boarding was underway when we got to the gate, so we just walked right on board. We checked our bags, so no issue with lack of overhead space upon boarding. Left a few minutes late, then a 30 min ground hold, again due to SFO air traffic. Once in the air, choice of free food and beverages on this short 1 hr flight. Choose the protein snack with cheese and crackers and deli meats, which was excellent and would have not had a problem paying the $8 price tag, if we were in regular coach. I love the order online at our seat option. When the flight attendants get to your row, they simply hand you your choices. Very efficient. Landed 1 hr late in SFO, but still plenty of time for our connection. Spent 1.5 hrs in the Admirals Club, then a 3 hr flight to AUS, with again satisfying food options and beverages with a good choice of movies and shows to make the 3 hr flight time pass quickly. Would have liked to see a sandwich or salad offering on this sector, as the menu was the same as the short flight to SFO. Arrived on time, our bags were the 2nd ones off due to Priority Tags due to our status. Over all still a great airline that will be missed. If I have a complaint with Virgin America, its the size of the First Class cabin, making it hard to buy FC on short notice trips.

21778,Virgin America,6,"""not very service oriented""",22nd August 2017,False,"  Austin to San Francisco. The flight from to SFO was uneventful and I had a pretty good experience. The return flight not so much. In the end, the flight was 2.5 hours late into Austin. There was no issue with weather; it is still unclear why we had such a delay. Virgin did a very poor job of explaining it and really provided no information about the delay until after our flight was to have departed.  Once we pushed back from the gate, it took about 1 hour before we took off. Then, about 20 minutes after take-off, some people started to get up to use the rest room. They were quickly scolded since the fasten seat belt sign was still on. Once the pilot finally turned off the sign, about a dozen people jumped out of their seats and formed a long line for the restrooms at the back of the plane. I waited a while, and once the rest room in the front was unoccupied for a couple of minutes, I went up and used it. I was in row 5, so very near the front. As I returned to my seat, the flight attended reminded me that the rest room in the front was for first class. I said I understood that but there was a long line in the back and they had already had us on the plane for a couple of hours, so I had to do what I had to do. She scolded me some more and made me promise that I would not use the first class restroom for the remainder of the flight. Then another person from row 4 went to use the front rest room. She refused to let him and insisted that he join the long line in the back. On other flights, we have been told that it is also against the rules to form a long line for the rest rooms. When the crew came through for drinks, they gave mostly ice and only about 2/3 of a cup of soda.  I felt that the flight crew was rude and not very understanding given the situation that they created for their customers, and not very service oriented.

The purple light in the plane is relaxing and the hostesses are always great. I love the Loft lounge before flights- it makes traveling much more enjoyable. It is $30 extra, but definitely worth it. Either purchase it online or get there early to be able to join it. Tonight I was flying from LAX to JFK at 11:05. Virgin has a policy that you must get to check in 40 mins before if you are checking a bag. I knew this policy which is why when I was in the LAX car pool I tried calling them multiple times because I was at gate 1 and the traffic was moving slowly. I decided to go check in myself and pay my uber driver to meet me there with my bags. I make it to the counter 2-3 mins after the cut off. The agent said curtly that she could not help me because I was late. I said how I tried to call multiple times, but no one answered. I asked what my options were (take off is still 35 mins away) and she said she coult try to put me on Standby for 7am. I asked what I was supposed to do for the next 8 hours and she said to sit on the bench or to get a hotel. I said I would be fine hanging in the Loft till then and I would gladly pay the upcharge because I did not book it for my late flight. She said the lounge was not open when I wanted since Alaska Airlines bought Virgin. I did not know anything about this.  Virgin is more expensive to fly to the East coast, and I never had a problem paying extra because it was better.

There was no explanation given for the flight cancellation. The text message included a toll-free number that did not work when I called it. It said I had a message waiting for me, but when I pressed ""1"" for my message, it said I had no messages. It was a fully automated line and pressing ""0"" did not connect me to an operator, it only repeated the cycle that said I had a message and then said I did not have a message waiting for me. I had to buy a $199 one-way ticket on Southwest that got me back to San Francisco at 12:30 a.m. Sunday. I had a meeting Monday morning at work that I could not miss and Alaska provided no options for rebooking on other flights that would get me back on Sunday night.

I do have a few minor problems with how my flight went and the care given to my luggage though. The smallest detail that got on my nerves was the fact that everything had to be paid by card, so if you're on a six hour flight with cash, make sure you eat before. They did give complimentary drinks once during the flight but that's all. Another little bug is that they had a very small selection of pretty much everything, entertainment-wise and food-wise. Again, these are just small tweaks that made my flight the tiniest bit worse, but the most important thing I mentioned was the care given to my luggage.

I ran to my Virgin America flight and go there 25 min before the flight departed to be told that they gave away my ticket because I wasn't checked in 30 minutes ahead of time. I tried to ask what was going to happen and she just told me to sit down and wait because she needed to get the plane going. She then called people on standby before me even though I actually had a reservation.

So they had rebooked me on a JetBlue nonstop arriving earlier than my scheduled flight! The level of foresight was excellent, I hadn't even learned of the delay issue before they fixed it. And I got an exit row to boot. So my new favorite airline, Virgin America, is one I've still never flown! (Contrast this with my flight out to Vegas on American Airlines, which refused to let me fly standby to avoid a delayed flight, despite having plenty of open seats, because I didn't have 'status'.

First of all, when I booked my flights, their system didn't allow me to make seat assignments because ""it was too early"". I tried again one week before my flight but almost all of their seats were grayed out. I called them to make the seat assignments and waited about 20 minutes to talk to a rep. While waiting, the recorded message cautioned me that I am going to have to pay $20 for using the phone service. Then the rep verbally assigned me seats that were never reflected on their website. I called again to confirm and they said ""it takes time for the seats to show"". I went to the airport to find that those seats are not mine and was given seats in the very last row next to the bathrooms! On the way back, similar screw up has unfolded. Called to make my seat assignments and found myself going through the same hassle. The rep lacked integrity and kept changing his story to force me accept seats in the last row again.

I proceeded to call them and spent four hours on the phone to get on a new flight. They confirmed me on several flights, I raced from terminal to terminal (mind you I'm pregnant) but because the supervisor took so long to confirm each flight I missed three flights in a row. I could have accomplished what they were trying to do (rebooking me through a flight on Kayak) in 5 minutes. Because they did end up rebooking me on a flight (which instead of being direct, flew through Boston and added 4 hours to my trip) they are not giving me a reimbursement, even though the supervisor on the phone promised to do so.

Flying in MCS gets you complimentary meals and non-alcoholic drinks and the meals offered are miles ahead of what any other U.S. carrier would offer. Cabin crews courteous and efficient both ways though a big letdown was when I couldn't charge either my iPod or iPad in an e-mail I received from VX Customer Relations they stated that too many devices charging at the same time results in a drain to the onboard power it is something they're working on and I received compensation for that inconvenience.

In short VA is looking a bit 'tired'. Service is inconsistent (eg like any organization most employees are good to great but the bad ones really stick out especially if they are 'experienced'). On this flight the seat was broken the food terrible and cabin service questionable. The plane interior is a bit tattered and worn from wear (ie soiled). Also the ""mod"" safety video is outdated (ie ""can I have just the facts please"") and it's a bit odd that alcohol is served at 7am in the morning.

21844,Virgin America,1,Virgin America customer review,19th March 2015,False,On 8th March I flew Virgin America in economy from SFO to LAS for $49.00 return. Was looking forward to the flight and it proved to be a positive experience. I was a bit put off by the loud rock music blaring by the check-in kiosk and a rather indifferent ground attendant herding people to and from the check-in area. I feel that airports are confusing and loud enough without the added distraction of loud music. I liked the mood lighting onboard and flight and crew very pleasant although the safety video was entertaining but to me a tad playful. The baggage charge of $25.00 was expected and on my return on the 10th of March I upgraded to First for $89.00 so the baggage fee was waived. The seats in First are very comfortable and pre-take off drinks were served by a very pleasant stewardess. Value for money on Virgin America on this trip was great and if you have checked baggage do the upgrade-it's well worth it.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,,5.0,yes

It was the first time I flew that they didn't walk down the aisle to ask if anyone wanted to buy headsets. When I asked the steward about the headsets she was annoyed that I didn't purchase on the computer screen. I really didn't want to wait another hour and she basically threw them at me and said to pay for them when I got a chance. On my flight home March 9 2015 as I was boarding the steward told the boarding agent that there was no more room for luggage in overhead bins. I was not happy about giving up my bag as I had things in there that should not go in a checked bag. She was insistent. When I finally boarded the flight there were 3 or 4 empty compartments right where I was sitting. I asked for my bags to be brought back too late was the answer.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,1.0,0.0,,2.0,,4.0,no

I was seated in 4D right behind Economy Select. This is probably the best Economy cabin I've traveled in. Stylish comfortable decent amount of room (I'm 6'3""). The staff are well-groomed and enthusiastic. There was some shenanigans on board with two parties who kept wanting to switch seats and the flight attendants handled it with humor and ease. I had a short flight under three hours so the complimentary entertainment options on RED were plenty for me. Also when I went to the restroom the flight attendant opened the door for me. When I went in it was quite large well lit and played spa music. Also when washing my hands the faucet actually stayed on long enough for me to wash my hands instead of me having to keep depressing it. Again a small thing but it's this list of small things about Virgin that have made me a loyal customer. I paid $49 for my trip from DC to Dallas. For $49 I got: excellent service comfortable economy seating and free entertainment.

So we got our boarding pass and headed to the departure lounge we sat there for a while and about half an hour before departure. Our name was called to the airline desk and we were told that as I booked 2 seats with extra leg room and I booked the first seats past the business class they said we’re going to put you 2 together, as we have a family that wants to sit together.  I assumed that they were going to just put us together but still in the same row I didn’t even bother to look at the boarding pass and the reason I booked these seats was that I’ve just had a back operation and needed access to the isle. As we got on the plane I realized that they moved us to row 5 which I had no access to the isle and the guy on the isle seat was fast asleep so I had to wake him up every half an hour to get out.

Their check-in machines kept locking me out. I had to pay $300 just for a single piece of additional check-in luggage, and it wasn't over the total weight limit either. And this is just for the return leg only. They changed details like thrice. They refused to take my debit card and I had to argue and prove I was cash broke (show 4 empty wallets) for 30mins before they even attempted to swipe it to pay for above $300 ""upgrade"", which worked second try after a system error. Their website didn't work. Their Business Class upgrade is somehow cheaper than the additional check-in luggage. The ticket counter flat out refused me before and after trying to check-in at the unmanned kiosks to upgrade my baggage allowance. The phone people refused to talk to me after the website would not let me upgrade the baggage allowance. Also, my return flight was changed with them wanting to simply just not do it with no refunds and charge me a higher amount. However, after some convincing on the phone a few weeks before, they reluctantly rebooked a new return flight only a few hours after the original. It's almost it's my fault for booking a seat on a flight that is not profitable (nobody else booked or not enough cabin count).",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Gold Coast,December 2022,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,2.0,no

We choose for VA because there was a lot of hassle going on with Qantas with exorbitant ticket prices. Given the only 1.15 h flight we gave VA a try. Their lounge was superb. Beautiful tarmac view, good food items, great showers (we arrived from SIN early morning and continued to Tasmania). Priority boarding for business class (only 8 seats in a 2-2 configuration). A fresh and clean plane. Great seats, a lot of legroom. A welcome drink was served. During the flight a more or less complete meal was served including ‘bubbles’. FA was very nice and did her utmost best to provide a feeling of warm hospitality. Remarkable was that the aisle between business class was separated from economy with a barrier (thick cord), purple acrylic glass separated the seats. It felt pretty private.

I followed up with customer service. They sent an email that completely ignored the situation and told me that you should get the flight 30 min before departure. What is the point of the lounge calling the flight if it isn't correct. Beyond that the customer service completely ignored the actual situation and just told me rules that didnt apply to the situation. I am transitioning over to another airline now but be warned.

21919,Virgin Australia,1,"""they should be providing service and support""",13th July 2022,False,"  Firstly, the booking system is rubbish, such that passengers are not able to manage their booking ourselves and must call through to the customer service. Though they do pick up the call pretty quick, it is pointless as all they can and will tell you is that they can't do anything for you (when they actually can). My husband booked a ticket for me to fly out on a Thursday to see my father in law who has just been hospitalised. However, something cropped up at home and I could not leave till the next day. I called to ask for a change of flight. First time I called, I was told all flights on Friday are sold and so they could not change it for me. I was naïve and believed in it. I even thanked the staff. But it then dawned upon me that I was checking the tickets online earlier and there are still seats available. So I called back again and the staff (I believe it's a different one) told me the same lie, that no seats are available. I pointed out to her that there are seats available online. She then told me a cock and bull story about how the system is not updated online and if customers were to go ahead and book online, they will get an error message. I then questioned them about truthfulness in their product publishing and advertising. It's a hoax then. I was certain they could do something about it and so asked to speak with a senior staff member. She put me through and funnily enough, this senior staff was able to find a seat for me on Friday, when the other 2 staff had insisted that all tickets on Friday were sold. However, I had to pay another $370 to have that changed. When my husband booked the ticket, it was stated that we are entitled to 1 change. The senior staff said ""yes you are entitled to 1 change but you need to pay the difference"". How is that considered ""entitled to 1 change""? As it was too much to pay, I was not sure if I wanted to go ahead or just simply cancel it, as it would cost about the same. Later my husband called them and explained the situation. They were insistent in ""not being able to do anything"" at first. But after my husband's persistently requesting, they finally agreed to a refund in the form of a voucher. This goes to show that they are actually able to provide some form of assistance to help us and there are many options. However, they choose to just tell the customer that they can't do anything and turn the customers away, forcing them to accept the flight or to forgo the ticket. I think these staff have either forgotten or didn't realise that airline is a service industry, they should be providing service and support. Even more so, if they expect customers to call their customer service line, there should be some real help offered.",Boeing 747,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Melbourne to Gold Coast ,July 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no

I took my seat up the back and immediately tried to adjust the air con to blow on me, but it wasn't working. I noticed other passengers around me doing the same. The air con did not operate  during the flight and I was so hot I felt like I was going to vomit.  I brought the issue to the crew's attention, one lady said she would 'look into it for me' and never came back.

The Covid19 and Virgin Australia in Receivership in the last two years resulted in no flights. However, about 35% of our fares was refunded, the rest was retained as travel credits. On 6/03/22 we submitted a booking request for 2 return tickets to Cairns in August 2022 using our flight credits. Now more than a month, there has been no flight confirmation from Virgin Australia despite an email request why there's delay, we might miss out. Its disgusting that the Airline did not cancel our flights when we requested a month before flight departure date. It waited until the day of departure to cancel a tactic to justify its policy of no refund. The fact is, we did not cancel our flight at the last minute. On the other hand if the Airline refused a full refund and we've now ask for a flight booking why now a problem? Are people with flight credits treated differently?

Check in line was long with none travelling business class. It was so slow that I went to economy as it was faster. No premium through security. Only one gate agent so it was confusing that premium had to basically cut the line. On board was lovely, nice staff, full meal (I had a poke bowl) but the Mainland pre packaged cheese crackers cheapened it, surely a bread roll is nicer, plus there was nothing sweet (a mini Kit Kat would have sufficed).

It's hard to tell what Virgin Australia is trying to be now, it's certainly not that much cheaper than a 'full service airline', and flying it today reminded me of why spending that bit extra turns flying from a chore to something enjoyable. The quality of the seat and cabin were poor, the seat offered no support and was cramped. No food of course, and that's fine. But does the cabin crew have to walk up and down offering over and over? The plane was ready on the tarmac on time, but the crew were running 30mins late. With people lined up to board, they announced the delay. (I noticed at a nearby gate, the Virgin crew were among the last to board the flight too). The pilot's landing was hard, a drop from the sky rather than a smooth glide.  On arrival, the cabin crew announced departure of some rows by the back doors. A few minutes later they said forget that, everyone out the front door. There was a collective groan in the cabin. It appeared there were no staff around to operate the stairs for the back doors. Finally the male cabin manager looked asleep and could barely say anything to departing passengers, while one of the hosties blocked departing customers while she was cleaning business class already, only to fall over into an Economy X row and complain how late they are.

As there is no option in the online book in to relay this I thought I’d do the right thing, not check in and get to the counter early to let them know.

Unfortunately due to personal issues, I was unable to fly for the last 4 months of so and was happy to be back in the air for a trip to Delhi on Vistara. I blocked the first row of economy class since the fare difference between economy and premium economy was quite high for the travel date. While the ground experience remains consistently good pre and post boarding. the in-air experience in economy has been quite degraded. For a morning 6 am flight, Vistara did not offer tea/coffee in economy class. The breakfast was very poor and my omelette was inedible. No condiments except a small roll and butter on offer.  Now coming to the Club Vistara program. I called up Vistara, 2 weeks prior to my flight, as I had 2 Upgrade vouchers and wanted to use one and asked them to recommend a flight on which I could use my upgrade voucher (any flight and ok with either Eco to Prem Eco or Prem Eco to Business) and I was told that no upgrades available even 2 weeks before flying.

I fly this route a lot, usually with Emirates or Qatar and had read some good things so thought I’d try out Vistara business class. The fun started at boarding in Dhaka where there was no business priority and an approx. hour queue to clear security in to the gate where three separate flights were taking off from. Dhaka is an old airport with security at the gates but other airlines manage it just fine. There was only one Vistara employee checking boarding cards and when I asked him about Business priority and told him I would miss the flight he just shrugged and walked off. I only made the flight by taking my life in my hands and queue jumping, nearly causing a riot in the process. The flight Dhaka to Delhi is Premium economy not business - the seat is even labelled as such. Transfer at Delhi very odd - despite having a boarding pass I was escorted to the transfer desk to be given another one. I couldn’t access the WiFi as I hadn’t been sent the code I apparently needed (and no one on board has any). And then having paid $20 for it; it cut off halfway through (despite being advertised as ‘whole flight’) and I had to pay again! And then to cap it off, on arrival at Heathrow the business class bags came off last rather than first, which felt like a good summation of the whole experience.

Due to delays on Vistara, the flight did not land in time to make the connecting flight to Udaipur - even though we were assured on the flight over to Delhi by the staff onboard that since the delay was about 40 min, the connecting flight would wait for the 20 passengers to Udaipur. At Delhi airport, the Vistara ground staff told us that the connecting flight had departed and that they were trying to figure out what to do. We were asked to reclaim our suitcases in Delhi and told that we would be booked on an Indigo flight that was due to leave in 3 hours time. No other information was provided for almost 2 hours, and we were repeatedly told when enquiring that the ""seniors officers"", who did not appear once in front of us were working on the issue. With less than 1 hour to go, we were handed printed paper tickets on 8x11 sheets with random passenger's barcodes on both side of the sheets of paper and told to make our way to Terminal 1. We now had to pair up with random passengers and travel together so that we could go through security at the other terminal. Nobody escorted. the group of 20 to Terminal 1, which is 20+ minutes by a shuttle bus that weaves through the city traffic to Terminal 1 from Terminal 3. We got to terminal 1 with 2 minutes before they closed baggage intake. As a premium economy passenger, the baggage allowance is 30 Kg on Vistara, and we were assured by the ground staff that the baggage allowance would be honored as Vistara had called ahead to Indigo. To our surprise, Indigo told us that no such calls were placed and that we had to pay for any excess baggage above the standard 15 Kgs. We had to shell out INR 8250 (over $100) for excess baggage just so that we could get on the flight. When I called Vistara to rectify the situation, I was placed on hold for 25 min and eventually the line was cut off. On the 2nd call, after a 15 minute conversation I was told that they could not do anything for me and that I have to return to the Vistara counter where the Indigo ticket was issued to argue my case in Delhi. When I asked to speak to a ""senior"", I was told that they would reach out to me in 1 to 2 hours. The calls never came. I am thoroughly disappointed with the service.

The staff both on ground and in flight treat the passengers like they are travelling for free. There is absolutely no respect given. On top of this the operations are terrible to say the least. The gates at Heathrow were announced 15 minutes before the gates closed. Considering the size of the airport it was highly inconvenient. The flights neither take of nor land in time. Our fight was supposed to depart from Delhi airport at 15:55 as per their boarding pass. But they called us to check our baggage for something at around 1545 even though the luggage was cleared at Heathrow airport and Delhi customs. They made us wait for absolutely no reason for almost half an hour. We had to run back to the boarding gate so that we don't miss our flight. For the price we pay the service is pathetic to say the least. The staff who are hardly exist around the airport are so arrogant and rude.

My experience right from conversations with customer service in London until my arrival in Poona suggests that there is a serious culture problem with the airline. I tried to check in online 5 times and called customer service for assistance. It was clear that the online check in needs more sophistication so I politely asked if they would take feedback to help improve it. The response was “no one has ever had such a problem”. The tone and response smacked of apathy and lack of professionalism. I have wide ranging experience with many airlines and customer service but haven’t experienced this as far as I can remember. On the plane, the stewardesses were robotic and cold, not to mention uninformed. The flight was late taking off from London. Thinking ahead about my connecting flight I asked if we could have the customs forms. These girls did not understand what I was asking and when I explained again they said there was no such form required. Arriving in Delhi, there was no ground staff to assist many of us who had connecting flights. To top it, many us who had priority and transfer tags in our bags waited 55 minutes for our bags. There was no ground staff to help. All of us missed our connecting flight due to the bags being egregiously delayed. I arrived in Pune in 24 hours.

When things fall apart, such as technical issues, Ground Ops at DEL is unable to plan ahead or communicate effectively. Despite having the three hours the flight was delayed to start making plans and arrangements, while 2 men worked, the other 3 men at the DEL transfer desk were either folding their arms or looking concerned, refusing to answer any questions while a dozen or so pax from a severely delayed incoming flight are either rushing for their connection or were simply brushed away without being given the basic accommodation.

The entire cabin crew are eager at work and does all they could to serve the best. Polite, courteous, warm-heart, smartly dressed and professional crew reflecting Indian culture! The catering is among the best. Do not miss the desserts.  A catch I noticed is AVOD should be updated with new movies and series urgently. The selection has to be more vivid, broader and up-to-date. After one flight, one can easily run out of options. While on-board product is excellent, where Vistara can really improve is ground customer service. Now for the third time, I got differing information in comparison to representatives on airport. The ground staff is divided on procedures and info. This can be make or break deal because it's not reliable.  Cabin crew should keep up the excellent work.

Premium economy cabins are spacious and so are seats. Cabin planning is good. They secure cabin from Economy class hence it feels private and less loud. The mood light shades they use are really appealing and food is just fantastic! In fact all flights originating from India, serves fantastic food! Hands down it's the best meal I have eaten on-board a flight. While I am at it, I might add that they can be bit generous with serving portions. IFE is bit boring and it needs more variety and latest movies. All this on one side and their cabin crew on another side. They elevate the experience on to another level. Vistara's crew are very professional and warm-hearted people. I could see that they are eager to help and nothing was trouble at all. Crew on DEL-FRA sector were the best crew I have experienced in my years of travel. They take individual orders from premium eco cabin and nothing comes from trolley. The whole experience made me feel at home. They exceeded the standards that of SIA and here after it will be my preferred airline to travel! If this level of service is maintained, once Vistara expands globally, it will give a run for buck to big 3 in gulf.

22040,Vistara,1,"""no option other than to pay up""",7th March 2021,True,"  The check in staff was not informed on the baggage policy, made me wait for about 15 mins while she checked with someone on call. There was no response from the other line and she made a random decision to charge me for my carry on bag (INR 8000) which was apparently way more than the cost of ticket itself. Her supervisor was just interested in moving the queue and she would not listen to the details of my booking. Eventually I was getting late for the flight and had no option other than to give in at that time to get my boarding pass. More details: I was flying from Chicago to Chandigarh and my domestic leg from New Delhi to Chandigarh was booked on United Airlines operated by Vistara. I had 2 check in bags + carry on bag + laptop bag, all under permissible weight limits and typical of an international flight from USA to India. I was not sure about the size of the aircraft in the domestic flight so I inquired if my carry on bag would fit in or not. They mentioned it won’t and even if it did it is above 7kg limit for a carry on bag and instead of taking the risk I should check in and pay for 15kgs instead. This was in spite of me showing them the Vistara policy which had to honour the same baggage allowance for connections from international flights within 48 hrs. Her recommendation was that I either magically get rid of my 8kg belongings or pay up to board the flight, given the departure time I had no option other than to pay up. To make matters worse the supervisor on the floor was completely rude and interested in chatting with her friends than pay attention to any questions from customers. Fast forward, I boarded the flight, half empty and huge spaces for carry on bags in the flights and knowing all that she still made me check in the bag for additional amount. I felt completely ridiculous and betrayed and I hope that the airlines invest some time in teaching manners and policies to their front end staff.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Delhi to Chandigarh,March 2021,4.0,5.0,,1.0,,,1.0,no

Boarding and departure was well on time and the seat was quite comfortable and soft. The extra legroom seats were very comfortable and it was also a pleasant surprise to know that the airline have also started resuming their inflight meal services which consisted of a veg sandwich, cookies and a bottle of water. There was also the inflight entertainment Vistara World which was accessible from the devices but I didn't go through it in detail although it seemed it had a decent collection of bollywood / hollywood movies. Arrival was ahead of schedule and baggage retrieval was also very smooth. Overall I have to say that this was an excellent flight service for such a short journey, I can only imagine how much better flying on premium economy / business would be.

It’s hard to understate the kindness, courtesy and helpfulness of every Colombian I’ve met in Medellin, Guatape and Santa Marta. That impression was tarnished when my husband and I presented our passports to the woman at the baggage drop desk. She told us that, contrary to the information I’d received from the platform on which I’d purchased our tickets, we were not checked in for our flight. However, the real problem was not that we’d arrived too late for our flight. The Viva representative informed us that she would not be able to allow us on the flight because we had arrived 13 minutes after the cut off time for check in. For check in?! Please note that this is a small airport where ordinarily, only 10 minutes are necessary to get from the entrance through security to the gate. But no matter how we pleaded our case, neither the woman behind the counter nor her bureaucratic martinet of a supervisor would budge. It was not merely that we were prevented from boarding our flight that we found upsetting; it was the way Viva’s staff treated us. At no moment did we receive a sympathetic word from anyone. When we tried to reschedule our flight, the supervisor coldly informed us that we’d have to fly out the following morning, then amended her statement a minute later. That flight was actually booked; maybe the next day. She was clearly anxious to dismiss us, impatient with our lack of fluency in Spanish. In addition to the chilly manners of its staff and its insistence on punctilious enforcement of its rules, Viva also qualifies as Colombia’s answer to the US’ Spirit Airlines. Prepare to be nickeled and dimed in every possible way. My husband has never had to pay extra for his very compact travel guitar on any of the many carriers he’s flown. Guess what. There’s a first time for everything. They were about to charge me for my yoga mat bag as well when out of shock, I dropped my water bottle and it broke spilling all over the floor.

There is something really wrong with how this low budget airline thinks when it comes to UX design and their Ethics on how they make money. It is incredible that I had booked a ticket for a short trip - 3 days for $270,000 Colombian pesos and ended up paying $600,000 in extras I ""somehow agreed"".  Instead of me activating all the additional expenses as a personal choice (Extra bag, Printing tickets, Express line, Insurance, etc) all those were by default activated for me. It was ""my responsibility"" to check in detail page after page and make sure all of those were unticked.  So after going through a process of reading carefully each page making sure you did not add by accident any additional unwanted and unnecessary additions, oh! surprised you ended up with a bill that is double the original ticket price. I understand you need to be careful when booking a low budget Ticket, but this is another level. This website was designed for people to make mistakes and then hide behind the Terms and Conditions policy making sure you pay for every single mistake made.  After my mistake I immediately called the call centre to try to rectify it ... to my surprise I was received by a call centre agent prepared to shoot me with all their policies, procedures, terms and conditions as a learned script. Turns out they do not offer any customer refunds. This airline receives hundreds of complaints of people experiencing similar issues on a daily basis. Calls like mine are their constant, as their tricks work and people end up confused and do not untick one, two, or all 6 extra unnecessary features. It is not ok to know you have a system that is designed this way and still have the guts to pick up the phone and blame it on the user. This makes me sad, angry and frustrated. If this review prevents you from making the same mistake of doing business with this sort of unethical business at least this frustration will have a purpose. Extras should be unticked and people should decide what to add. I don't go to the supermarket with a cart full of stuff and on the counter start selecting what I don't want to take with me.

Baggage check unfairly charged, from Lima to Cusco USD $160. Baggage check in unfairly charged, from Cusco to Lima USD $94. Flight change fare unfairly charged, from Cusco to Lima USD $60. Flight change negative balance not refunded - from Lima to Cusco USD 25 as well as from Cusco to Lima, that we should have been refunded To be clear, I am pursuing this matter with Viva for a refund. In addition, the flight experience was pathetic.  No Customer Service – Both sides (Lima to Cusco) we were assigned random seats. We requested to be given at least 2 seats together so that one parent could sit with one child at least. However, your staff was insensitive and rude.

22080,Viva Air,1,"""excuse to keep their customers’ money.""",20th August 2020,True,"  Viva Ar has recently cancelled my Lima-Cusco-Lima flights and issued me a voucher minus an administrative fee for the cancellation that they initiated! The voucher has a 180 day validity. They blame the Peruvian government's attempts to control the Covid-19 pandemic and completely ignored the following arguments: First, for Viva Air to charge an administrative fee for a cancellation that they have initiated is simply outrageous and in violation of standard airline practices. In fact, if an airline cancels flight because of bad weather or a disaster due to a tornado, for example, the standard and decent practice is to give customers a full refund for the moneys paid. The Covid-19 pandemic is actually worse than any weather disaster and a full refund is legitimately due. Second, for Viva Air to arbitrarily impose a 180 day limit on the use of the voucher under the uncertainties of the current pandemic conditions is not acceptable either. As the Peruvian experience of the last 5-6 months indicates, it s completely unpredictable when it would be possible for tourists to safely travel without risking their lives or well being. Specifically, there is no certainty about any of the following: (1) Whether some airports will be open or closed and when, and what other means of transportation will be available to tourists. In fact, air, train, and bus transportation has been prohibited for weeks, on and off, in most regions, provinces, and cities in Peru. (2) What travel restrictions will be imposed and what points of interests and attractions will be open or closed to the tourists. (3) What regions, provinces, or cities will be quarantined, when, and for how long. Not knowing this, tourists may be trapped in a quarantined place for weeks. (4) Peru is actually one of the countries with more severe problems due to the Covid-19 pandemic in South America. Thus, weekly repatriation flights for U.S. citizens and legal residents have been implemented since the pandemic started according to the U.S. Embassy in Lima and the State Department STEP (Smart Traveler Enrollment Program). This alone indicates that everything related to the Covid-19 pandemic is very unstable in Peru and it is impossible to plan any travel for an undetermined period of time. (5) How long the mandatory stay-at-home order for people 65 years old or older will last, or when it will be reinstated if lifted. This is something that may affect different regions, provinces, or cities at different times, imposing a severe displacement or travel restriction on any senior traveller or tourist. In fact, I am currently a 77 years old U.S. citizen and simply cannot travel under these circumstances. In brief, Viva Air owners and administrators are using the Peruvian government attempts to control the Covid-19 pandemic as an excuse to keep their customers’ money.

Viva Air first changes our flight times - but we could manage these times so we accept them. However, a few weeks later, Viva Air cancels our flight that day. We had to fly that day though, because our return flight to Europe was the following day. Although I requested refund from Viva Air via e-mail (it was not possible through their website), it took 3 weeks before they replied, and they constantly told me that they will give me a voucher, valid until November 2020. I told them on every occasion that I am not in Peru and cannot do anything with the voucher, they insisted that they will send me a voucher; they even stated that I requested a voucher via their website - which I definitely did not - and they did send me a voucher. I have now roughly sent 75 e-mails to Viva Air, but they still refuse to refund the money. I was in contact with the local authorities, but in order to start a case against Viva Air, I have to present myself in person with all documents ... Peruvian bureaucratie ...

22084,Viva Air,1,"""it's just really dishonest""",18th April 2020,True,"  In terms of the actual flying experience, the planes themselves are relatively new (at least the ones I flew in), I found there to be sufficient legroom, they were very clean and even comfortable. They tended to arrive and depart on time and there were minimal disruptions here. The problem lies within: 1) Booking anything on the website and; 2) Making any small misstep along your journey. I work in digital design and UX and like to think of myself as quite adept when it comes to booking flights online, either on my laptop or mobile. Until I needed to book flights with Vivaair. It works by automatically sticking on all these little extras through their ""Combo++"" packages, confuses you to the point where you don't know what you have paid for (they have these three packages which come pre-selected, or you can handpick your extras, and oftentimes ""inadvertently"" making you double up). I had to start again many times over, as it just became so convoluted - obviously intentionally designed to confuse you. Vivaiar's booking system is at best misleading (not to mention unethical) and makes Ryanair's website seem like a walk in the park. I just hate to think of the number of people it has conned out of their money this way which I'm sure is part of their business model. 2. So maybe this was partially my fault, I'm not sure. On one occasion I had to pay a proportionately hefty penalty for not having checked-in online and doing this at the airport instead. Fair enough. The second, was when at the time of my booking, I selected check-in luggage instead of extra carry-on luggage and paid a premium for this (my luggage was actually just a standard carry-on sized suitcase, I just had a backpack on me as well). On the day I arrived quite early to the gate. The staff at the desk here (who I struggled to communicate with in Spanish or English) made me aware that there was an issue, as I had not checked-in my bag. He said he would come back and rectify this for me (to which I was oblivious at the time), as he gestured for me to sit down. He, of course, never returned, and I was forced to pay £60 for this misdemeanour (this is in Colombia, mind you.).  I would have been ok to pay a small fee as it was a misunderstanding on my part .. but £60 is enough to pay for one night at a very good hotel in the capital. Finally, one of my flights was cancelled from Lima to Bogota due to the COVID-19 crisis and government borders closing down. Vivaair sent me an email to say that this flight was cancelled (as expected), as Peru had already shut down all air traffic. Once I was back in London, I spoke to one of the customer service agents via their chat service about requesting a refund for this cancelled flight. The response I received was from their agent was ""Sorry refunds aren't allowed. Any flights can('t) be refunded, besides the flight was not cancel(ed) by the airline, it was cancelled by the airport"". Not to mention that I had to reconnect to the chat so many times, as the moment it takes you to the front of the queue, it gives you a mere few seconds until you are automatically disconnected sent to the back of the line.

She then said if I didn't want to pay 50 soles per person for them to print it, I would need to leave the airport and go look for a printer and come back before my flight left! How rude!! What kind of manager says something like that to a customer? There was clearly a discrepancy between what was on the e-ticket and the confirmation. I informed her that I only got the e-ticket the night before and showed her the date on the email and didn't have access to a printer in Lima.

I booked a ticket from Lima to Barenquilla with a connection in Bogota. Paid extra for hold luggage / fast lane boarding on both. Got to Bogota only to find our luggage on the caracel. It shouldn’t have been there. We were told at check in it would be transferred automatically to our second flight (in line with what we paid for). Ran to check in and were told check in was closed so we could not get on the flight. This is despite explaining that it’s clearly their fault. We wouldn’t have even gone to check in if our bags had been transferred correctly. They said “no you’re late” then said we’d have to buy another flight ourselves tomorrow. No discounts, no refunds, no hotel accommodation for tonight. Not even an apology. After complaining for 20 mins we were told we could take the bags through as hand luggage but would have to pay £104. We did, had no choice, would have cost more for a new flight + hotel. We’ve asked for our money back but they won’t respond to my emails. Unbelievably bad service from this awful company. - They sell you connecting flights but mistakenly put your bag on the carousel at the wrong airport - They don’t admit their mistakes and will charge you for every error they make - Plus they’ll happily make you pay £104 (more than the flight) or you’ll have to buy a whole new flight plus accommodation. Also they: - Purposefully sit people apart to force you to pay for seats (don’t fly if you’re a family) - Charge you £50 to get your boarding pass printed at check in. - Won’t transfer you onto a new flight if your connection is delayed. Do not fly with them if you have to take a connection. At best you’ll have to pay £104 and sprint with 15kg bags across the airport.

Next was the most interesting. I always travel with cabin baggage only that weighed 8:2kg. Checkin stipulated 10kg maximum. I thought great, I’m under. As I reach checkin the VivaAir employee grabs my bag and goes to the size stand and tries to shove my Universal cabin sized bag that has never been a problem to fit in the overhead cabins on any airline and says no it won’t fit. I thought no it’s not going to fit in that. So I was charged 69 USD to take my bag as cabin luggage and it would have been a few more dollars if I opted to check it in.

We walk the entire terminal to the farthest gate. I’m leaving out that at every one of these stops, they check all our documents. Multiple times.

I always do check in at home at least 12 hours before flight. But unfortunately the app and website didn't let me check in. We arrive at the airport 2 hours before take off and the woman at the counter asks us where we're flying and we tell her. Her response is you're not flying tonight. I'm like what do you mean? She says airline policy is you to arrive 3 hours before. I explained what happened with the error message and she rolls her eyes and calls another employee. He says the same thing. I ask well what about the ticket we purchased, with insurance. He says not our problem and gives us the 800 number to try to resolve the issue. So we start calling at the airport. Then a guy came up to us and said to do the checkin in the app because he had just done it. So clearly the flight was not closed. I tried in the app again but no luck. No one answered after an hour waiting. We left the airport because her flight left. At home I kept calling and another 50 minutes without any answer. So I had to buy my mom another flight because she had to be there the next day for her brother's funeral. I called early morning to try to get help with the refund. And i asked about their policy about flight closing, she stated it closes 1 hour before. When I asked the insurance they said the reason for missed flight was not under the 27 clauses and that I should of called an hour before take off. I said I did but they didn't answer. I called the 800 line at the same time another day and no answer. When I spoke to a supervisor I asked him ""how am i at fault if their employees don't answer or do their job"" he rudely said they always answer the line. So we bought insurance for nothing and forced to pay for an emergency flight. When I went to pick up my mom at the airport days later I went to the departures floor for the airline. I asked an employee about the flight closing policy and she again stated it closes 1 hour before. I asked to speak with a supervisor and she said he was ""busy"". So I left my name and phone number.

On a flight from Guadalajara to Vegas we had to switch to another Viva flight by waking a 1/4 mile outdoors at the Monterrey, MX Airport. I like exercise, but c'mon. We asked two staff about baggage and were assured it would be transfered. After over a dozen calls, most because they left my wife on hold then hung up on her, she was told one bag was found in Monterrey.

We arrived at Huatulco airport for our flight going back to LAX via Mexico City. Our connecting flight to Mexico City was supposed to leave at 3:20pm (flight 1093). We were in the check in line at 1:30pm. By this time there was already a long line for the check in counter. Problem was, there was no employee attending the counters. Checked the departing board and it had our flight delayed by 3-1/2 hours! Our flight for 3:20 has been bumped to 7pm. Three tour bus full of people came in to check in for their flight to Guadalajara that leaves at 4pm. They only started manning their counters at 1:45pm. At a certain point they realized they needed to check the Guadalajara people in so these people could make their flight. People who had the Mexico City flight was stopped from checking in and we had to wait 3 hours in line until they got through with the Guadalajara people. When they finally opened the counter for check in to the Mexico City flight, we got checked in but not given a seat. This lead us to question why we do not have a seat. We were told that the flight is full. We asked if that means we were on stand by. The counter person said yes. We asked “does this mean we can get bumped off of this flight?” He said yes. This guy did not even have the courtesy to give us this information! We had to ask! He wasn’t being upfront! When we asked why this was so, he said the flight is full. He started to help the people behind us and said he will help us after he helps these people. We let him proceed with them and when he was done, he started helping the next people in line and completely disregarded us. We’ve asked for someone else to help us and we were told that someone will be coming in 10 minutes. It has been an hour and we are still waiting. We have a connecting flight in Mexico City that we will surely miss at this point. There is only one flight out of Mexico City to LAX serviced by Viva Aerobus per day. Do these people care that we will miss our connecting flight? Do they care that we will miss at least a day’s worth of pay? Or have important things to attend to? Or that they need to, at the very least, give us the courtesy of the information that we can get bumped off from this flight, even though we’ve fully paid for it?

The original airline ticket was leaving Veracruz going to Guadalajara Mexico and then from there into Houston. I knew there would be a layover in Guadalajara as I have friends in Guadalajara I plan to go to dinner with them, so there was a three hour layover in Guadalajara. Coming back I planned on leaving Houston at 4 o’clock in the afternoon arriving at Guadalajara at 6:30 in the evening and had another flight out of Guadalajara to Veracruz landing in Veracruz at 10:30 PM. A week before the flight I got an email that said there was going to be a change because of flight operations and I was then flying out of Veracruz and going to Monterey have a three hour layover in Monterey and then into Houston. I was not happy about it but things happen and I realize that. Then my return trip from Houston into Veracruz what a nightmare. Was supposed to leave Houston at 4:30 in the afternoon headed to Guadalajara and then from there to Veracruz. Three days before my trip I got another email from the airlines saying that they had rerouted my trip and now I was headed from Houston IAH to Monterey with a 10 hour layover. So I never did make it to Guadalajara instead I spent the entire time at the airport in Monterey. And I am actually writing this review at the airport. Now here’s the real nightmare when I went into Monterey I had to go through immigration which let me out into the main part of the airport so I went outside to have a smoke then came back in to eat lunch, the place I wanted to eat was upstairs next to the Gates called Texas fine foods.

However, on the day of the flight, I was unable to check in, with a message saying that I had not paid for my flight. This was untrue, as my bank showed a successful transaction on May 21 and no issues had come up since then. I also received no emails or error messages. We immediately tried calling Viva, but the phone line hangs up about 5-7 minutes into the call (confirmed by anyone else who has tried to contact them). Also tried messaging. So, we got to the airport as early as we could, stressing because we didn't know what was going on. When we got to the airport, we were refused check in, then had to go across the airport to the ticket sales counter, and argued with 30 minutes a with a rude employee telling us that our tickets had been canceled due to ""fraudulent activity."" Funny that the fraudulent activity was only flagged on the day of the flight. I then had to pay over $USD1100 to make a new booking (original tickets were $380) and make it home in time -- I had no other option as we needed to get home for work and it was the last flight of the day. The employee could have simply let me re-pay for the original tickets at the very least so it could be easily disputed with my credit card, but she was too careless to understand the situation and knew we were desperate. After she started ignoring us completely for about 10 minutes of me trying to come up with a solution with her, we felt we had no other option. So Viva forced us to buy new tickets. We boarded the flight, which was marked as completely full, but with 2 seats empty (our seats). I have been trying to contact them for the past 2 weeks for hours a day. I get hung up on after 5 minutes of waiting, and have received no response from them even though I have tried contact form, email, Facebook, and Instagram. My partner has also tried Twitter.

We arrive at the airport 3 hours ahead of our departure time only to be told there were no seats available and that I had not ""purchased seats"". Then what did I purchase, my airline indicated the time and date of our departure? I can care less where they sit us. This was the way for them to try and justify that fact that they had oversold airline tickets. Then another agent proceeds by saying ""all airline over sell tickets b/c sometimes passengers don't show up"" What do they care if passengers show up or not, that's not their business, the ticket was bought and paid for? My friend and her two young girls were traveling on the same flight. One of her daughter's ticket ""supposedly"" indicated it was for an infant so they made her purchase another airline ticket, mind you an agent had already told us there were ""NO"" seats available, but get this another passenger had purchased an airline ticket and selected her seat only to find out she wasn't going anywhere either.  They didn't even have the courtesy to reimburse us. All they could do was beg other passengers to volunteer to stay behind so that my family and I could board. They got us on the next flight, but no compensation.

Our flight was on Thursday March 24 2022 once we arrived at the Reynosa Airport they made us pay to take a bus down to Monterrey airport because supposedly since the 1st of March they came up with a new law that no one can fly from border airlines without their passports, but we would have understood if they would sent us an email, phone call, text or even let us know thru our app about the changes made but nothing at all, we had to find out once we arrived at the Reynosa airport. After all this mess we get to Monterrey by bus, their they delay our next flight for 13hrs to Cancun and once we get their we have to repay our paid lounge because they stated the lounge was payed from the flight from Reynosa to Cancun.

So I did, they say it's now 48 hours so no refund, also no supervisor, call on the day of flight and get $50 back. So I called again today. Got hung up on by someone in Monterrey. Called again and agent says no supervisor and try again tomorrow. He says there was only one note on my account and I joked it probably says crying lady wants her money back. He says not everything is about money and when I tell you, having to explain that I wouldn't keep calling if I could afford the $200 ticket price loss. Never buy from VivaAerobus.

Honestly we had no issues and I would fly it again. The line was very long to check our bags, but we knew it probably would be and arrived 2 hours and 15 minutes before our departure. It took almost an hour to get through the line to check our bags, but we saw that they would announce flights leaving soon and pull passengers out of line to check their bags so they could make their flights. Which was a nice touch because I feel like a lot of airlines in the US wouldn't do that, and if you miss your flight, ""tough luck, you should've arrived sooner."" The plane was nicer than a lot of Southwest airplanes with plenty of leg room in our row (which was 29). One issue though: I paid for seat assignments when I booked the flight, and for some reason it reassigned our seats prior to check in and split our party of 3 up. Wasn't a huge deal bc I realized it when I went to check us in and was able to pick new seats for us 3 to be together. However, we had seats in the 8th row originally, then it had to be the 29th row.

22179,VivaAerobús,1,"""They are unreliable""",6th November 2021,True,"  I had a flight from Tijuana to Puerto Escondido on November 5th. First, they delayed the flight a few days before, which is pretty typical of them. When I was in the terminal everyone was confused on which flights were flying from which gate and there were no employees there to help at the kiosks. After an hour of being in the terminal I was able to find my gate, which wasn't showing the correct information or have someone manning the kiosk. When the flight was delayed another hour, no one told all of us waiting through any means of communication, we all had to swarm the attendant when he walked by. Our flight was delayed another hour and an hour after that it was canceled. The front kiosk gave everyone a number to call, which did not work and told everyone to go to the front check in to ask questions. I waited for three hours to talk to someone at the front desk and literally all she gave me was the same faulty phone number and as option to have my flight for 11.30pm 2 nights later. Everyone was upset and some people had their flights canceled two nights in a row and no compensation for the inconvenience. I didn't trust the airline to actually have a flight that would be reliable so I flew back home from San Diego. VivaAerobus claimed the reason for the cancellation was the fog, but I literally flew out of San Diego a few hours later, an hour away. Some planes were still landing at Tijuana and there wasn't much fog. The worst part was trying to get a hold of the company. I had been calling and trying different menus for hours in the airport and talking in circles with the bot. Whenever I got a hold of someone, they would transfer me and drop my call. Terrible communication and it's impossible to get a real person. When I finally reached the manager, they helped very little and only gave a refund on the flight they canceled, not the flight that I had as my return (which I couldn't even use since I wasn't there!)

It's only an attempt to charge you extra. I had a backpack and a ukulele with me. I was told at the check in counter that the ukulele was fine. Then in this second bag check line the guy said I had to pay a $599 peso fee ($30 USD) for special handling of the instrument. I was not happy about this as the instrument is much smaller than the majority of the carry ons that people had. I didn't have a choice, the instrument wasn't even mine, I was bringing it for a friend. I paid the fee thinking they were going to put it somewhere secure for me. No, I showed the stewardess my receipt and she said just put it in the overhead. Seriously? Then what was the fee for? I put it in the overhead and it fit perfectly front to back. They were just making a grab for extra fees. I was angry, I should have never gotten in that line. I have messaged Viva Aerobus asking for a refund. I doubt I get it.

Absolutely no compensation whatsoever. No food voucher, no future credit (that I'd never use for this airline). Worst service ever. Flight was canceled because inbound previous flight was delayed to the point customs & immigration was closed, and aircraft was not available.

I accepted the change. The following day, I was told that my incoming flight was cancelled and there were no other direct flights. All other flights available that day were 8+ hours in duration. I asked for a refund and they said that I could not get a refund as it was not one of the 27 reasons why they give refunds. Keep in mind that they changed and cancelled my flight. Not me.

Literally every time I fly with them and they don’t really seam to care. In addition to that, they close their ticketing counter one hour before the flight because the people that run the gate desk are the same ones that work at the check in counter. So if you are running late, you won’t be able to check in, even though you know the flight is going to be delayed for an hour and a half!

I asked for a refund and they said no refunds. They offered a voucher to be used within 80 days but I refused this offer. Why would I want to book with this carrier again if they cancel flights with no notice and don't offer refunds? The agent wouldn't allow me to speak to a supervisor and was very rude and not helpful.

However, she advised me to continue to security and I even waited an hour to board, when it was time to board I wasn't allowed to board because the customer service representative had canceled my flight without even notifying me. The representatives didn't know what to say but they said they will give me a ticket for the next flight to my destination. Upon arriving to speak to management, the manager sent me to sales and sales sent me to the same customer representative who canceled my seat. She then proceeded to say I'd be lucky if she could give me a flight for the next day or two. She was beyond unprofessional and rude while continuously laughing at my situation.

Our transfer service in Cancun was cancelled because the driver couldn’t pick us up so late. We lost one day in Cancun because we just slept all day after a sleepless night and you just say “sorry”. Very disappointed but that's not all! I guess there were lots of security violations (letting people store their hand luggage in front of them in the first row, somehow safety demo was only in Spanish).

Now, I find that hard to believe and think that the airline had overbooked their flight and bumped me off. I get to the airport and explain that I never received any email notification regarding my flight changed and they would not budge. They didn’t even consider putting me on standby and they told me that my only option was to take a 10:40pm flight (I arrived at the airport at 12pm) and I would have to pay the difference which ended up being close to $200. In total, I spent a bunch of money and wasted a ton of time (10 hours to be exact.) The airline is insanely disorganized, flights are always late because they don’t know how to board people on the plane properly and they will charge you for any and every thing. I would run for the hills before flying with this airline again. Not only that, but the customer service agents in the Cancun airport that work for Viva were not willing to help me at all.

I booked a direct flight in June 2021 from La Paz to Monterrey for a Wedding and my flight was canceled (not rescheduled, just canceled). The only other options that day added an additional cost (at least $100+ USD) and anywhere between 8-20 hours of flight/layover time. Obviously, this didn't work, because I was going to a wedding and depending on flight would have booked additional accommodations in another layover city or miss the wedding. Neither of which worked. I called and spoke with the airline and was told no refund. I spoke with an airline supervisor who said the same. I told him the situation and he had zero sympathy and said to feel free to call my bank to dispute but he would not refund. They give you 2 options when they cancel your flight: 1) An electronic flight certificate. 2) Flight change.

In March 2020, the COVID-19, pandemic was in full swing and by the time March 16, 2020 came around, our government made the call of having each individual state make decisions on closing down non-essential businesses. On top of this, there was a strict travel advisory concerning certain countries. I watched the news night and day trying to figure out if I should go because I also knew my bone graft procedure required a 5 to 6 month healing timeframe. I called my dental office in Cancun several times inquiring if there was any news from their administrators, I also watched news pertaining to Cancun, read news articles from Cancun and read numerous travel advisories from the US Dept of State concerning Cancun / Mexico. I was told that everything was a go by my dentist. I also kept calling my dental office, my hotel and finally VivaAerobus 1 week prior to departure to inquired what would occur if I should cancel due to the pandemic or if there had been any changes due to the pandemic that I need to be aware of. But Vivaaerobus customer service agents told me that my flight on March 23, 2020 had not been cancelled nor do they see of any future changes or cancellations for both my inbound or outbound flights. All 3 Vivaaerobus CSR agents who I spoke to prior to my departure on 3 different occasions each said the same thing including that “I would lose both of my airline fares for myself and my hubby and that I would not get a refund because it was a non refundable ticket.

I felt I had no choice and I didn’t want to lose our hard earned money so on March 23, 2020, my hubby & I went off on our trip. We had the Vivaaerobus App installed on both of our cell phones and we were able to check in and obtain our boarding pass 24 hours before our flight departed from Charlotte, NC.

We made it to our gate 2 hours ahead of our 8:00 am flight and our plane was already parked at the gate. There was only 1 other passenger waiting for the flight.

I concluded my dental appointment, constantly checked my VivaAerobus App for notifications none were provided by this airline. 10 hours before check in on March 27, 2020, the VivaAerobus App would not allow us to check in nor obtain our boarding passes. It showed an message which stated that we had to check in 2 hours before departure. We called and the 1-800 number but It was constantly busy, we sent emails/ inquiries through online chat to VivaAerobus but got NO RESPONSE. We decided to purchase a ticket with another airline.

The staff were of no help they only told us wait. We were not able to get on the flight. When we asked for a refund, they also denied this. We were told the next flight is a 4 am! Absolutely horrible customer service. Not one employee helped or showed any remorse for what they did. Additionally, my luggage was damaged by them.

They suggested family members with no symptoms should be able to flight. They does not trust you as passengers, they asked for things like: birth certificate in order to proof 1st degree blood relationship of passenger without symptoms and asked for proof of residency when I requested full refund because vouchers are completely useless for me.  Only way to communicate is email, each email is a new inquiry and takes 15 days to get a response. If you don't get a response you have to send another email asking for the response of the previous inquiry and this add another 15 days. One simple request is taking almost months and counting.  Call center is useless, they say they are not part of ""cuentanos"" and you have to reach by email. If you ask to speak with a supervisor you will get denied (this is basic customer service) So avoid this airline unless you want to spend months sending emails to interact with costumer service and waiting with incomplete responses; or if you believe you should travel by plane with covid symptoms.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cali to San Andres,June 2022,,,,,,,1.0,no

This company's business model is completely based on theft and extortion. I arrived with a bag that fit the description of the limits on my  ticket (purchased from Kiwi). Since I could not print out my tickets, the night before I reserved them online (for what was supposed to be less of a charge). Not only did they make me pay twice to print out my tickets, once online and once in person at the MDE airport, they even acknowledged the fact that I even booked this service the day before, but that I would still have to pay an additional fine. And, that they would only print out one ticket and that I would have to pay again to get on my connecting flight in Bogota But it gets much worse than this. Even though I made sure that my big fit the size and weight limits put on my ticket, the dimension and weight requirements were different at the door. They did not express empathy or understanding of this fact, and simply made me pay the fine of $75 USD (more than the ticket price) just to bring a normal backpack designed to fit as a carry-on on board. Since I had no choice but to comply, I paid the $75, was given a receipt, and was assured that my connecting flight would accept the receipt as payment for my luggage. However, once I went in line to get my ticket for my connecting flight at the next airport, they informed me that I would not only have to pay the printing fee again, but that I would also have to pay a heftier $125 fine to bring my carry-on backpack to Lima. This price is absolutely unheard of. I have flown on AirAsia, RyanAir, and the fees that VivaColombia charged me were nothing short of robbery. In other words, the company lied to me, told me that I would only have to pay one fee, forced to pay double fines for printing tickets, and refused to accept the size and weight requirements listed on the ticket I purchased. This company is an absolute embarrassment to the people of Colombia, the airline industry, and is a model of what a terrible company looks like who values money more than the customer. .

They are a budget airline however in the end you pay more for an experience so bad it's actually difficult to put into words.

It is the most ridiculous service I've encountered in all my long years as a traveler. Tried using their website to purchase the tickets, unable to get through, bought the ticket via phone, all seemed OK, only to receive an email two days later indicating the tickets already paid for have been cancelled. I'm still waiting for the refund to my CC, no explanation why. Had to buy new tickets. They will charge you for just about everything, right from printing the boarding pass ($16,00 US) to assigning seats (plane was not even half full), to a bottle of water or a snack. The flight was delayed almost one hour forcing us to miss the connection flight with another airline. The customer service at the airport, on the phone, through e-mail was just pathetic, not helpful at all. No offer of any compensation. Forced to purchase new tickets for the next day. Curious enough, while in Bucaramanga, we decided to purchase a flight ticket for a relative, and the story repeated itself again, initial purchase OK, confirmation OK, only to find out two weeks later it has been cancelled and it will be a while trying to get the refund, meanwhile, initiating a new purchase.

22259,VivaColombia,1,"""I will never fly with them again""",11th September 2016,False,"The flight itself was not bad, for the price I cannot fault, however the customer service is the worst I've ever experienced. I flew from bogota to Santa Marta arriving @ 8:50 when I got back to my hotel I realised I had left my passport on board. I got a taxi straight back to the airport unfortunately the plane had left. I asked one of the desk staff to make sure once the plane landed in Bogota to get one of the crew members to check my seat as I knew 100% that I left it in the pocket seat in front of mine. She told me it wasn't her responsibility and that I'd have to ring myself. I explained to her on google translate because I don't speak Spanish and pleaded with her to ring on my behalf, it was just a simple phone call for her to make but she refused and waved me away. I rang VivaColombia myself but as predicted nobody spoke English so I went back to the desk and pleaded with her to ring, she eventually agreed to get someone to check the plane once she had time. The plane went back and forth from bogota to Santa Marta 4 times, each time I asked one of the VivaColombia staff to check the plane but nobody did, at 7pm that night after spending 9 hours in the airport one of the staff eventually approached me and said they searched the plane but found no passport nor did any of the staff report that it got handed to them. I was fuming, one simple phone call when I first reported it and I believe I would have got my passport back but nobody cared one bit. Over the next few days I emailed the airline numerous times to see what they were doing to try and retrieve the passport but I kept getting generic emails back saying it is not viva Colombia's responsibility for any lost property. They did nothing to help find it. I had to get an 18 hour bus drive to bogota from Santa Marta and go to the Airport myself and check with the police, the lost and found, immigration and security and inquire myself because it wasn't VivaColombia responsibility to take five minutes out of their day to Call into the above offices which are all right next to each other in the airport, instead they emailed to come and check myself giving no consideration that I was hundreds of miles away. Unfortunately police or immigration didn't have the passport either so I had to get an emergency travel card and fly back to Ireland to try and get a new passport leaving my girlfriend behind in Colombia by herself, in total it cost me $3800 to get it all sorted. I know losing the passport was completely my own fault however I feel with just a small bit of consideration from the airline and some costumer service I would have got my passport back and all this could have been avoided. As long as I live I will never fly with them again and I urge anybody who reads this to do the same, it's all well and good when everything goes smoothly but if anything happens to go wrong you are completely on your own.

Since it's a low-cost airline, you shouldn't be expecting luxury. For instance, you can't check-in luggage without paying for it, same thing for food and drinks on the plane.

During this time we witnessed more staff members than customers casually chatting behind the desk. When we would ask for information about what was going on we would be told one thing, only to be told something different half an hour later. Communication is not this companies strong point.

I flew to Colombia with an instrument, my guitar, paid a fee to take it as carry on and that's it. When returning home to Miami, the Viva Colombia Airline crew denied me taking the guitar and said I need to send it through with the bags. Of course, anyone that knows a Taylor Guitar is around $1,300 USD and it would insane to send it with a bunch of bags. I attempted to speak to the front desk staff who said no, spoke to her supervisor who did not even care or was a bit concerned about my problem. She said it was protocol to not take instruments as carry ons and that Viva Colombia in the States shouldn't have allowed me to bring it in. She apologized on behalf of their staff and just walked off. I called the person above her who was even more nonchalant about the situation, she could not have cared less.

22263,VivaColombia,2,"""the lowest class of airline""",16th April 2016,False,"  Lima to Bogota, and Viva Colombia is a low cost airline like no other that I have had the misfortune of travelling with. Taxes are not included in the ticket. You pay this at the counter in cash (Dollars only). To add to insult, an eticket or boarding pass on your phone is not accepted, it needs to be printed. As expected the staff will refuse to help you with this. They rudely suggested we have an hour to pay them, find the money, or find a way to print it ourselves or not be allowed on the flight we paid for. They can print the pass for you at an extra $15. If you did not check the correct number of bags online that's an extra $15. So it comes to $30. Again, as mentioned lets not forget the taxes you need to pay in cash at the counter. So that makes it $45 extra. All in all, it then becomes the same price as flying on a national carrier. On the flight itself, it's first come first serve in terms of seating as with most low cost carriers. However, being a late night flight, one would expect the lights to be dimmed or turned off at some point, so some people could rest a little. This was not the case at anypoint, hence few were able to sleep. In terms of the Emergency exit, they only allowed one person to sit next to each one. In my humble opinion, that defeats the point of safety. If people are far away from the exit, it takes longer to escape in the unlikely event of an emergency. In terms of Emergency, at no point was their ever any briefing given by the cabin crew.

Arriving a touch early at Antwerp Airport, check-in and security were quite quiet, so it was just a matter of a few minutes to pass both check-in and security, while waiting to board (Very small airport, so don't expect much to do after security.) Once the aircraft was ready to board, it was just 15 minutes to be fully ready to start up and depart. The Fokker 50 they were using was surprisingly neat and clean from the inside for an aircraft of this age and was quite spacious to stand in the aisle. After an on-time departure out of Antwerp, the flight was quite smooth and the flight attendant started to serve us with a complimentary drink and snack of your choosing, while the flight crew kept us up to date about their procedure into London City and the estimated time of arrival, which to me was well done. Turbulence appeared into approach of London and landing was on-time. The most surprising factor of the flight was that the noise was quite low for a turboprop within the cabin. After a on-time landing, the boarding was quickly done in a safe and mannerly matter and all that was left was to wait for our luggage to arrive on our belt, which probably was the longest wait.",Fokker 50,Business,Economy Class,Antwerp to London City,July 2018,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,4.0,yes

Consequently we left 20 minutes late. Once in the air the flight was fine (about 70% full) cabin crew managed one bar service and one tea/coffee service during the short flight and handed out Belgian chocolates (at least this VLM feature has been retained).

Once check-in had opened a friendly agent spotted that I was only carrying hand baggage and pulled me out of the queue and successfully got me checked in using the s/s machine. Gate (03C) was announced about half an hour before boarding. Gate area is on ground floor directly opening onto the apron and was very poorly heated! Boarding was by bus to the aircraft at a stand. The plane a Fokker 50 was very cold on boarding but soon warmed up once the engines were started. Internally it looked a little tired but who cares on such a short trip? Seat pitch in row 8 was excellent. Inflight magazine said 32 inches but it felt more than that. Cabin crew did an excellent job of serving lunch (cheese or ham rolls) drinks and a chocolate to the quite full flight in the short time available (they also handed out boiled sweets before pushback). The flight continues from LCY to LUX and continuing passengers don't have to disembark - virtually everyone who boarded at MAN disembarked at LCY though. All in all a very pleasant experience. I usually only ever fly between Manchester and London at times like Christmas when there's no/poor train service but the convenient location of LCY for me (living in Kent) means that I would consider this route again - especially if I can't get a cheap advance ticket on the train in which case VLM's fares are often a quite reasonable alternative.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no

Comfortable seat and great leg room. Highly recommended.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
22296,VLM Airlines,5,VLM Airlines customer review,16th June 2008,False,LCY to MAN. I had checked in on-line and printed my boarding pass. The flight had originally been delayed 20 minutes but in the end departed on schedule. As others have stated the service is excellent although I dont like foccacia bread (a crusty roll would have been my preference). That sad the quality of the chicken sandwich was high (fresh and full of flavour). A chocolate muffin was also served. The tea tasted like real tea and the use of china cups is a nice touch. A good airline and one which deserves to continue its success.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
22297,VLM Airlines,5,VLM Airlines customer review,28th April 2008,False,MAN-LCY-AMS-LCY-MAN. What flying should be about. Great staff at checkins and onboard good food and coffee without having to pay for it and real cups too. This airline that I had never previously heard of seems to believe in old fashioned good service at competitive prices and they make a profit so it can be done without penny pinching and charging extra for everything. Highly recommended.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
22298,VLM Airlines,5,VLM Airlines customer review,22nd April 2008,False,LCY-MAN-LCY - Superb service in a recently refitted F50. On time both ways and good in flight catering for such a short flight. On the return to LCY I left a item of property on board. The effort to trace the item was outstanding and it was returned to me within days after making only one call to VLM in London. Forget the train to Manchester from London. Go with this airline at a third of the cost.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
22299,VLM Airlines,n,VLM Airlines customer review,4th July 2006,False,LCY-MAN-LCY Booking well in advance saved considerable time and money over the equivalent train journey. Cabin crew were pleasant but I do wonder why on such a short flight it's necessary to offer food albeit just a sandwich - I'd rather pay less on the ticket price. On the return journey the ground staff at MAN were extremely helpful to let me switch without charge to an earlier flight. Overall I found VLM efficient and helpful and would certainly use them again. After all flying in a Fokker 50 puddlejumper was actually fun!,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
22300,VLM Airlines,n,VLM Airlines customer review,2nd June 2006,False,LCY-BRU. VLM isn't a bad option but the comparison with Eurostar on the Brussels route isn't credible. I can get so much work done in comfort on Eurostar on both the outbound and return journeys using my phone when I need to. Give me that rather than a bumpy Fokker 50 often delayed/cancelled by fog any day!,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
22301,VLM Airlines,n,VLM Airlines customer review,17th May 2006,False,LCY-BRU. I go to Brussels regularly on Eurostar but on this occasion tried VLM. The service was excellent given the very short flight. It was far cheaper than Eurostar and was also quicker even taking into account the time needed to get to the airport. The only problem with VLM is the frequency - 5-6 flights per day is not enough to compete with the train and the timings are not great for a business day trip from London. If they had an equivalent frequency to Eurostar I would always use them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
22302,VLM Airlines,n,VLM Airlines customer review,27th April 2006,False,LCY-BRU and what a great little airline this is. OK plane was old cabin crew were not smiling all the time but apart from that I was very impressed. I read many nice comments here but it was better then I have expected. Check in easy and very fast boarding 10 minutes before departure and still left on time pre take off sweets drink in proper glass coffee in china nice (not particularly tasty) bacon baguette very tasty pre landing chocolate. Cabin crew were present in the cabin during all flight and were nice but didn't smile. I was sitting in the last row and being cabin crew myself I wasn't impressed by cabin crew reading newspaper during landing when she should be in her landing position but I have seen it many times on many different airlines. I didn't even mind that plane was one of the oldest in their fleet as I love turbo props and the noise they make. It's great to fly lower then on jet planes as you get nicer view. For 55 quid I paid for my flight I would give the whole experience 9/10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
22303,VLM Airlines,n,VLM Airlines customer review,17th April 2006,False,Have nothing but praise this airline. A competitor cancelled by misstake our return leg out of Liverpool to Basle and the ground staff was not helpful at all (to say it in a polite manner). What a difference at the VLM ticket counter. The woman knew our situation and offered us a reasonably priced ticket to LCY from where we could continue our journey. As we booked last minute and security checks etc. took longer we got denied boarding at the gate as the flight would have left late if it waited for us to be bussed to the aircraft. Received free lounge acces in Liverpool (A special offer at the moment) and free rebooking to the next flight. Friendly FAs served candies upon boarding and free food and drinks during the short flight. Of course it was somewhat like a cold hamburger but more important is the way they treat you. You might pay a bit more but you get treated as a human being. Arrival in LCY was smooth and in the terminal within minutes. Called their London office a couple of days ago for a copy of the electronic ticket. We need that to reclaim the money from their orange competitor. This request was handled promptly and with no problems! Their Fokker 50s are ok for the routes they use. All in all reminds me of what Crossair used to be years ago. Friendly staff nice service etc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
22304,VLM Airlines,n,VLM Airlines customer review,1st April 2006,False,Flown a few times from LCY-MAN in the last couple of months. Service has always been great - easy check in easy 'onto the plane' and great service once airborne. Only downside is the walk you then have through terminal 3 at MAN as the plane 'parks' in-front of T1. Flights always depart on time and usually a few minutes early into MAN. Prices invariably cheaper than travelling Virgin trains and on a Sunday the time comparison (1 hour as compared to 4+) makes it all worthwhile.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
22305,VLM Airlines,n,VLM Airlines customer review,29th March 2006,False,London City to Manchester. After reading other passengers comments I was expecting a great service. This is far from what I received. My original flight was cancelled with no reason or explanation given they managed to swap me to another flight but that was running late. My colleagues on the 7:20 flight didn’t take off until 10:30. Upon boarding the fokker 50 the cabin crew (just one person) may just have been wearing a sign saying “I’m having a bad day” the attitude was absolutely terrible. It would be unfair to name this person but she did not smile once during the flight and was stern and just so unfriendly. There were no pre take off sweets. I do not understand how anyone can say VLM’s food is good you get offered half a brown sandwich in a plastic wrapper or fruit not even both and no plate. Certainly no chocolates as others have mentioned. On a positive I had a problem with my e-ticket for my return trip and the lady at the VLM ticket office at Manchester airport was helpful friendly and smiled! Shame she isn’t working as cabin crew!,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
22306,VLM Airlines,n,VLM Airlines customer review,18th March 2006,False,Manchester - London City. Very impressed. Flight was called for boarding 10 mins before departure and was greeted by 2 very friendly FA's seating fine for a 50 min flight offered pre take off sweets. Once we took off Crew offered Ham or cheese sandwiches complimentary drinks from the bar then tea or coffee finished off with Belgian chocolates. All drinks were served in china mugs and glass tumblers made it feel more like Business class. Arrived on time and as I arrived at the luggage belt my bag was already there within five minutes of Landing I was on my way into London. Excellent service Excellent Crew. No complaints,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
22307,VLM Airlines,n,VLM Airlines customer review,13th March 2006,False,I fly Manchester - London City with VLM on most Friday mornings (the 9.30 am flight) and it appears to be a reliable service. Wheels up is normally at 9.45 and you are on the ground again at 10.30. A good price of £41 all inclusive is available if you book about 3 weeks in advance. It is not a lot quicker than the train for city centre to city centre travel but in my case I am going from South Manchester to Essex and there is an hours time saving.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
22308,VLM Airlines,n,VLM Airlines customer review,30th November 2005,False,I recently flew for business from London City to Rotterdam returning from Antwerp 3 days later. When our return flight was cancelled after a freak snow storm the only option we were given was to transfer to the 8am flight the next morning which itself was by no means guaranteed to depart. We were told point blank and with a shrug of shoulders that a refund would not be possible nor were we offered food vouchers transport or accommodation all of which we had to pay for ourselves. Such a shame to let themselves down so appallingly when they perform well in other areas. A colleague encountered an identical situation with Air Berlin the same week and was immediately offered a full refund - no questions asked.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
22309,VLM Airlines,n,VLM Airlines customer review,15th October 2005,False,I commented earlier this year about the food being tatty. There has been a considerable improvement in the food offered good news in that respect ! If you are a regular passenger on the Manchester / London City and use the late afternoon / evening flights you may have noticed recently that for some reason departures and arrivals are frequently delayed. This is a real nuisance when you have to have commitments at the other end. These flights are used by mainly by business and professional passengers who have commitments. The challege is for VLM to get its act together and improve on the service which has been most disappointing of late. Time is money.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
22310,VLM Airlines,n,VLM Airlines customer review,11th October 2005,False,London City to Jersey 15.50 Friday 16.9.2005. Firstly delayed because of fog. Then taking off at 8.00pm. Then cancelled because of 'weather conditions ' - so no compensation and no alternative but the 6am flight the next morning. How do you get to LC airport at 5.30am ? At what cost is the overnight stay and the transport let alone the cancelled appointments loss of a day's paid holiday etc ? VLM personnel unconcerned; supervisor unavailable ( 45 mins later turned up) No compensation no accommodation overnight . No transport and the airport closes shortly. Lies about weather conditions to avoid compensation for cancellation- other flights were landing in Jersey all this time as confirmed by other passengers being met in Jersey.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
22311,VLM Airlines,n,VLM Airlines customer review,9th October 2005,False,Amsterdam - London City (3rd October). No hassles for check-in with a total of 14 passengers on the flight (Fokker 50 with something around 50 seats I presume). Flight left on time and arrived into London City airport 5 minutes early. Excellent service from the two cabin crew during the flight including information on how to reach the city from LCY airport. Inflight meals were great (I did end up eating a business class meal but economy meal looked fine also for a 45 minute flight). Will certainly fly VLM again should they fly where I'm heading!,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
22312,VLM Airlines,n,VLM Airlines customer review,6th October 2005,False,I flew London City to Brussels with VLM and found them to be a very friendly and professional airline. Boarding was very quick and we took off on time. Shortly after take-off we were given sandwiches and mini Belgian waffles which I didn't really expect. The Fokker 50 was quite spacious with Grey leather seats. We had plenty of head and feet room and the aisle was wide enough to walk down comfortably! The return flight was exactly the same quick check-in and boarding with friendly staff and a clean aircraft.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no

When I tried to apply the voucher number, it showed only $1,000 pesos available. I called the customer service but they didn't see $2,000 pesos even thou I have email from volaris stating that I was receiving $2,000 pesos for the damage they caused. I decided to use 1,000 pesos which was all the available credit amount (don't know what happened to $2,000 they originally stated) to purchase the tickets. Then I emailed volaris but they don't seem to understand or they just don't want to admit that they ripped me off for $1,000 pesos I haven't used. Then I attached pictures of my new tickets with cost and screen shot of email regards to $2,000 pesos credit voucher originally they issued. I haven't heard from them since.

She told me the flight was closed and she wouldn't do it, said I had to go to ticket counter on the other side of the airport to get boarding pass, I would not have made it back in time. I had a seat and a reservation. So I asked could I get a later flight maybe for the next day. Without looking at the computer she told me no! Said nothing was available until 3 more days! Without looking at the computer! So I was stranded at LAX at midnight! Had to call a family member to come and pick me up. Not a good thing for a 75 year old woman. So now I'm out $684 dollars!

Customer service is basically like talking to a frustrating robot who have pre-scripted lines and are unable to deviate from the scripts. Its like talking to AI that doesn't really understand you and gives answers that don't inform you of the policies nor help solve a solution.

I also explained that I had my car at CBX and this inconvenience is not only costing me time but also money. They offered me a $,1000 pesos voucher which is like $50 US dollars. They did not want to fix my parking fees although CBX is stationed inside the airport. I did not take the voucher as I never plan to travel through CBX or Volaris. The airport representatives also treated the situation as a joke and continued to refer me to the airline. No one took responsibility for this terrible inconvenience.

No explanation just seems to be their usual ways. Service was rude and incompetent, took about two months to get my money back. By the time they cancelled the flight all other flights were full and prices skyrocketed. Not their problem, they just returned the amount we paid months ago, even if we could no longer get anything around that price. They gave us a fishy 20% or so credit. It was a yet another scam, hardly usable for my family since you need to activate it, it’s issued per passenger, and it expires days after, and only covers the main passenger of your next reservation, so I would need to do different reservations for myself, my wife and each of our kids. The only good thing was that after adding the very basic (hand luggage and seat), we realized their “sale” price became higher than that of a real airline, even after their fishy credits and so called discount, so we realized there wasn’t any reason for us to even consider flying Volaris ever again.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Sjo to Dulles,October 2022,1.0,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,no

In the past three years in particular Volaris has put all it's efforts into shaking every penny and peso out of the customer while becoming the least on-time airline in the Americas. But this last experience was the one that made me say, I'll never fly Volaris again. We were checked in, had paid for Premium seats, and were traveling with carry-on bags and small personal items (purse and briefcase). We got to the gate early but waited to be among the last in line as is our preference. When we got to the agent to scan our tickets she told all passengers they were going to weigh our carry-ons again before we could board. To my surprise they had a small portable scale at the ramp. We were ordered to put our carry-ons on the scale and mine was just at weight. Them the agent told me to put my briefcase on top of the carry-on, which cause me to be two kilos over. Same with my girlfriend and other passengers. I argued that what they were doing was not only unfair but causing the flight to be delayed as they had just one person collecting payment. I was told to pay up or forfeit my flight. So I offered my credit card (as did almost all other passengers) and was told this was cash only- and in pesos. I did not have pesos. The woman in front of us also didn't have enough in pesos, so we each offered $100 bills and were told in the most rude manner that we would not be able to board our flight. We missed that flight, received no refund or credit. What I noticed was that there was no receipt being given. Here they have a portable scale but no credit card machine? I asked to speak with the supervisor at the airport and went to see her. She was the same person that barred us from our flight and was demanding cash. I tried to file a complaint but Volaris has no such department or oversight at all. I tried for some time to reach someone to tell my story and have never been contacted in return or received any follow up at all from Volaris.

So we decided we would check in at the airport. When we got to the airport we waited in the check-in line for 40 minutes. There was only one employee working the check-in line, and they were taking super long to help people. They also kept disappearing for 10 minutes after helping someone. Meanwhile there were about 5 employees just standing around, not doing anything. They were directing people to wait in line, and talking to themselves. It was a stupid use of resources. A lot of people in line were complaining. When it was finally our turn, the employee told us casually that our flight was cancelled and we can take the next flight in 8 hours. We did not receive any text, email, or call about our cancellation. If we knew the flight was cancelled we would not have shown up to the airport so early. We ended up spending around 12 hours at the airport for no reason. Once we got to the gate for our flight, it kept getting delayed because the plane still had not arrived. It was so frustrating. It took forever for us to get boarded. Unfortunately we also had booked with Volaris for another flight from Oaxaca to Merida. And of course the flight was delayed by 1 hour 30 mins, but they didn't mention anything about the flight being delayed. So again we showed up to the airport earlier than needed. It's very frustrating but we didn't say anything because we were not in a rush. When we started boarding the stupidest possible thing occurred. At the very last second as we were boarding, the employee told us we need to weigh our bags. I do not know why they waited until we were at the front of the line, as we are boarding, to make us weigh our bags, when the flight was already delayed by so long. After we weighed our bags they told us we need to move some 10kg from one bag to a different bag, or pay $750 pesos. They really wanted us to sit there and try to move 10kg from one bag to another. That is completely ridiculous. The bags are normal travel size and fit perfectly. We argued with the employee but they wouldn't budge. They held up the entire line and pressured us so that we had to pay the stupid fee. It was so unnecessary because both the bags were going onto the carry on spot anyways. They just charged us a fee and scammed us. It literally made no difference because we still boarded with the same bags and same weight in the bags. This airline is horrible. Do not book with this airline if you do not have to. They delay flights consistently.

Though that lady was really understanding, it was when the time to get on the plane that angered me and people around me. They had switched the plane number stations last minute without telling anyone. The counter people were rushing us and hurrying us and even end up yelling at me and my sister pushing us to the side separating me and my grandmother which is what i was trying to avoid as she cannot read or write. I had tried asking for help as it was the first time flying and without my parents to help guide us. Counter lady was yelling at everyone but didn’t want to help because she wanted everyone on the plane at a certain time even though they started check ins very late. We then encountered the same issue again about my sisters ticket not having her second last name and when i tried explaining to the lady that the people downstairs said it was fine she kept interrupting me asking for my last name. I was visibly frustrated as i was already separated from my grandmother. As i was able to meet up with my grandmother a lady behind me was complaining about the same thing about being rushed. We both talked about it as it was frustrating because many of these people are boarding with grandparents and are doing double the work with their own ticket and their grandparents ticket.

Made it down there OK and when it was time to return to San Antonio I I found out they oversold the flight and I couldn't get on and they wouldn't do anything about it at all it was horrible.

But I had to do that when you have people watching your house and your pets you can't get back one or two days later when they have to be at work and school. I could've just spent $800 and gone with a class carrier like Aeromexico in the first place. A really stressful situation and horrible and being down there in a different country there was nothing I can do about it except pay more to Aeromexico to get back in time.

The “best” they could offer me was a flight 18 hours later with no compensation of any kind (keep in mind I just finished the first flight, so I’m in a foreign city with no hotel reservation or anything). I suggested scheduling another connection that would take 12 hours less and they denied the request due to a “rule”, which when I asked for clarification they refused to provide any. Also, since it was an international flight and I wasn’t allowed to check in my bag until 4 hours before departure, I had to carry all my bags around with me for those 18 hours after an exhausting 6 hr flight in a random airport.

Then after you pay they have a separate line for those that didn’t pay so you can still go in with carry on with out paying makes no sense. I waited in line like any normal customer for boarding, then as about to get in they said I needed that little piece of paper from immigration, it’s that they didn’t have any extras there so they told me I had to leave out of the airport, and then back through security. I told them I had my computer bag stolen a there in Mexico a few days earlier so to just let me fill it out in the plane or when I land in US. They says no, I then took off running like they said, can’t back drenched in sweat and they said I couldn’t get in because they cut off to board was 1:47 and it was 1:53.  Meanwhile people were still boarding as I could see them going up the stairs into plane. Then they sent me to a different gate to get a new ticket for the following day, they charged me an additional $100+ to get a new one.

We purchased a non stop flight five months ago on a specific day because we have jobs to return to. The only other options they had were all ten hours lay overs. So we had to cancel our flight and purchase through another airline less than a month before our trip. That's another couple hundred dollars I had to pay.

Idk airport voucher, free tour in Cancun or excursion just SOMETHING to make up the difference in what I am now having to pay due to their inconvenience. They couldn't offer anything but a refund which takes 7-10 days to process. I can't believe they don't have anything to offer to make this right.

We had our flight booked for Cancun to Portland from 2pm - 9pm on the 28th with a short layover in Guadalajara. To start, our first flight from Cancun was delayed 40 minutes, making us late to Guadalajara and our flight to Portland had already left before we arrived. The flight attendants did not know how to help us in the slightest, we were re-directed to several different employees all over the airport before finally being directed back to the main lobby and had to wait in line just to speak with the check in staff. When we were finally seen, the employee accused us of missing our flight and when we explained that it is was not our fault he told us the only available flight was the following day at 9:30am and that we would have to pay for an additional Covid-19 test before he could provide us with the boarding passes. I won't even get into how terrible the process was to get the test done. After, we returned to the check in desk for our boarding passes and had to wait 40 minutes before being seen again. A different employee helped us this second time and again insisted it was our fault that our flight was missed, this person barely spoke English and had to translate through text (which was fine, as long as we got through) however, he kept walking away from the desk to ask a coworker questions and obviously was having trouble getting our flight figured out. Once he was finally able to do so we were told that we would not be able to check our luggage in until the following morning, mind you this at 7pm. So in addition to having to wait 14 hours for our flight home we were not permitted into the departure area we had to wait in the airport entrance in a Burger King lobby until the following morning. We got up early to make sure we were ahead of the line and even the at 3am the Volaris check in was packed of people and it still took us an hour to get checked in. Overall very disappointed in the service of this airline and will not be recommending or using it in the future.

22377,Volaris,1,"""Everyone at Volaris has been extremely rude""",30th April 2022,False,"  On Friday 04/29 I dropped my parents off at CBX for their trip to finally see their parents after this awful pandemic. Per CBX they recommend arriving 2-3 hours prior to your flight. So, they arrived more than 2 hours before their flight at 12:55 AM. They checked their baggage, went through security and everything was running smooth until arriving to the gate on time. At their gate they were told they missed their flight. Mind you this is not just two passengers; 40 passengers did not make it onto this flight. Every single Volaris employee had a different excuse as to what the issue was and answered very entitled and rude to any questions. Volaris attempted to rapidly re-book people onto other flights to anu city in Mexico, (because this was a Volaris issue) however, their offer was to Leave Sunday night and return Monday morning…. (literally just land and get on the flight back). Obviously, that was not an option so this morning we are attempting to at least get credit for another flight If not a refund. We spoke to Jasmine who passed us onto her supervisor  who hung up on us. We have not been hostile or rude to anyone and as VIP members of Volaris I cannot believe this is happening. Everyone at Volaris has been extremely rude. To top it off after being told they could not board the plane and had to return home, CBX would not allow them to return without paying for a new crossing ticket, which was already pre-paid on the returning flight but did not count as a valid ticket.

22378,Volaris,2,"""the worst airport customer service""",26th April 2022,True,"  Volaris has the worst airport customer service I have ever experienced. Our family had to wait one hour and a half in line just to check our bags (we were in the customer with special needs because we had a baby and we were unable to print our boarding passes at the kiosk). I understand the special needs line can take longer for obvious reasons; however, they only had two counters helping customers and at some points they only had one (because the personnel was in and out). It seems like Volaris staff don't care about the time people stand in line; they seem apathetic, and also understaffed. Once we got to the counter, the lady was helpful, but at first I thought she might send us back to the end of the line because we didn't have our boarding passes. Luckily that didn't happen because I told her we already had been in line for an hour and a half and we were going to miss our flight if we did that. Once we got passed the check-in counter and onto security, that was another ordeal. The person checking the boarding passes said the stroller had to go through a different line. It was so confusing and frustrating because then another lady told us only one person can go through the stroller line and that the rest of the family had to go through the regular line. I didn't know what to do, and then the lady said ""or you can all try going through the same line but you will be sent back"". She was completely rude when she said that. We decided to take the risk of being sent back, and then we saw an entire family walk past us with a stroller and a baby and they were not sent back! Once we go passed security everything was fine. Additionally, I don't like how Volaris charges for everything, even for carry-on bags when other airlines don't do that. The checked-in bags were $80/each which is way too high compared to other airlines that charge $45-65.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Guadalajara to San Jose,April 2022,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,,,3.0,no

There is very limited communication you have to do with them, WhatsApp chat or a Facebook chat. If you use the whatssap or Facebook chat know it will take you at least 2 days to get what you need. They respond every 4 hours to your messages so be sure to put all the info into your messages every time you respond. I got a message in Spanish after 4 hours and it took me another 4 to get an English person on Chat. It will take you a day to resolve their arbitrary flight change they  imposed on you.

22381,Volaris,1,"""this is how our system works""",13th April 2022,False,"  My friends bought flights to come visit me. Volaris boasts of having cheaper flights but you have to pay for your seat and either have to pay for an upgraded ticket if you want baggage OR pay for your carrying on and checked baggage. If you have to cancel your flight (due to COVID for instance, which is what happened to my friends), they only give you vouchers for the flight costs (not seat, not baggage, not taxes, so you lose all that money). If you bought a round trip, they split the money you paid into one voucher for your flight to the location and one voucher for your flight back from the location so that they are equal amounts. When you go to buy your new flights (that you have to purchase within 90 days), you have to buy the flight there separately from the flight back. This means that if your flight there is more expensive than your voucher, you have to pay the difference (so my friends have to pay over 100$ extra each for a family of three for their flight to Mexico). If your flight back is cheaper than your voucher, you lose all of that money (which for my friends is more than 100$). So they are losing over $300 more in addition to their seat and baggage and having to pay over $300 dollars more!

I have tried to reschedule and everytime I click to pay the remaining balance, an error pops up. There are now only 6 seats left and I have been trying for the last 2 hours.

Not only do you have to pay for extra, which includes bags, seats and much more. But the hassle of flying with them is not worth it. The crew is ok, a mediocre job for a mediocre airline. My flight was just under two hours late of the boarding time but that was enough to make me write a review. I have never felt more disappointed in an airline than Volaris.  The plane arrive late but within 15 minutes we were already boarding. Which is good, only if you like sitting in nasty, chip crumbs filled seats that aren’t even properly sanitized.

By giving Frontier Airline agents our reservation they notify us that we could not travel to Chicago since they could not find our reservation. Frontier Airline agent advises us to contact Volaris to notify them that the reservation was incorrect. Had to call Volaris right in the spot. After about 10 minutes, talking to the Volaris agent, he informs us we cannot travel from Cancun to Chicago that we needed to go MXDF and leave MXCD at night arriving to Chicago at midnight. We absolutely did not accept. The Frontier agent asks me to speak to the young man from Volaris to explain that there were 17 seats available that he only need the confirmation number from Volaris. The young man from Volaris insisted that he cannot give us the confirmation number since we must travel to MXDF and from there to Chicago.

Paid for all the extra luggage, seating, priority boarding and all the horns and whistles to make a hassle free flight to Miami. Finding out it had me arriving and departing Miami on the same plane that takes me there. I originally wanted to Depart MEX January 28th to Miami and return to MEX on the 7th February. It had both flights scheduled for February 7th. I had to make the departure change when I got there. To make the change was charged 3368 Peso's, USD $162.43 per my visa card charge. Fine, I expected that. But when to check in at the counter is when all the craziness started. - they charged me 5368 Peso's = $258.54 Dollars to check 2 Bags! 1 each for the 2 of us flying which was suppose to be included in the premium services I paid for. The staff at the counter didn't even know how to charge my charge cards on 3 attempts saying they were rejected. Had to do a currency exchange and pay cash or not check luggage. As we were flying to Miami to catch a cruise ship we had no choice and had to be on the early flight or miss the ship. After all this nightmare, I called my bank and wanted to know why my charges were rejected. They told me no charges of such were ever attempted on my card. Why their website would allow such a booking on the same plane is redundant and not at all user friendly as it shifts back and fourth when you are trying make your booking.

22410,Volaris,1,"""customer service is basically non-existent""",26th January 2022,True,"  Volaris initially sold me on their flights due to their promise of ""lower"" prices. I even paid to upgrade my seats to the front of the plane and was excited to get a decent deal during a holiday. Upon my initial check in at the airport, the problems began. Volaris told me I had two sets of tickets, which I was unaware of (as I only received one email with one receipt!) I told them I only wanted one flight and the assistant said she would take care of it. She apparently did and we boarded the plane and vacationed. Upon our attempt to return, we were told there was no flight for us, as our tickets had been cancelled! Upon further review, it was found by a Volaris agent, that the prior assistant had cancelled the flight I had the paperwork on, and had left the other flight open. The issue is, the return flight was on different date that was a week prior to our scheduled return date, and which we knew nothing about! The agents in Guadalajara would not budge and since we have responsibilities, we had to get home and had to buy a subsequent return ticket. The agent assured us that the other ticket for a ""missed flight"" would be refunded by contacting customer service after we returned. Volaris customer service is basically non-existent and not of service. You can never get a live person on a phone line, unless you're buying a ticket. I used the email link, to which Volaris states will be responded to ""within 2 days"" - I've written three emails, each a week apart--and I have had no response! I sent a Messenger message and have gotten no response except an animated, antiquated number system sending me in a loop. I finally got a horrible response on Whatsapp that told me it was too late to request a refund, since I had ""accepted"" the initial flight and had ""missed"" the return flight. I should state here, that the return flight we repaid for, was not full, either! So here I sit with Volaris claiming there's nothing they can do---for their mistakes, which as cost me twice what I was originally paying! Thus, my flight has ended up costing me far more than any other airline would've in the first place. It's a scam! Volaris doesn't have low fares. They're there to cheat you out of your money and your flights.

I myself fly quite frequently and I find Volotea among one of the best airlines that I have flown with so far, booking of flights is done fast, the price is clear and there are no hidden costs or unnecessary extra charges. The process before the flight is very user-friendly. This time we also had some questions about luggage policy (just needed a confirmation that every passenger can have his own suitcase) and I sent an inquiry to their Client team and got an answer within the promised 3-days period. As for our departing and returning flight - whole process (check-in of passengers and luggage, boarding) went smoothly and what I liked the most was that the flights were punctual by their departures (no delays, which is a very positive surprise lately) and the arrivals to both destinations were also even ahead of schedule! Another example of good practice that Volotea uses and that I find very useful is by deboarding when they invite passengers to stay seated and only to leave their seats and the plane progressively (usually when a plane lands, all passengers stand up and then wait crowded for dismemberment, by Volotea, flight attendants announced in advance that passengers should stay in their seats, and then - when everything was ready (hand luggage, connection to the terminal established or stairs and buses outside ready) - they called four rows in a row to disembark and by that avoid unnecessary crowding.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Venice to Olbia,November 2022,5.0,5.0,,5.0,,,5.0,yes

Booked ‘priority boarding’ and the whole package and it was a bit weird that they came out, quickly served us a Kit-Kat and a packet of almonds and then disappeared without a glance at anyone else. Despite the strenuous written restrictions on baggage dimensions and weight, which I had been very cautious about, everyone else appeared to be on the Silk Road and were all bringing the contents of a small store on board. However, as it was, on this occasion, a fairly innocuous experience. Very much could do without having to download the app or print out boarding passes (who can print when on the road, seriously), or pay an extra 30 euros per person for the privilege of having them go through the onerous business – all that stuff and the moveable feast that is the baggage restriction really leave a bad taste.

Volotea has a strict policy that you have to check in two hours prior so we made sure to get there well in advance. Well no employee from Volotea showed up to the airport to work the counter until an hour and a half before the flight. We were charged $60 for late check in.

Collected our passports (3), and ticket confirmation provided by Trip.com checked her computer then said we must pay $30.00 each total $90.00 to fly because we did not check in online. When we said we were not told we must check in online she said that Trip.com should have told us and to call them though we did not have international phone or Internet (US residents). I said I would do the online check in having accessed airport Internet. She said it was too late at 4:25 am to complete it, it was “closed” because it had to be done at least 3 hours before flight. When I asked for a supervisor she said no, then suddenly her English was not so good. In addition to the $258.00 already paid for the round trip fare, we had prepaid an excursion for an additional $300.00. We were forced to pay the additional $90.00 or lose $550.00. On our return from Santorini airport I asked the Airport agent if we had to pay an additional fee for our return to Athens (on Agean). She looked at our printed ticket information and with a knowing look snd said “no, that’s only them, you won’t have any problems”, and I didn’t. Beware of Volotea and Trip.com who when I called and explained the situation said it was the buyer’s responsibility to go to the airline site and find out their rules.

Every time I've flown with them everything has been correct - no delays, planes are comfortable and somewhat clean, crew is generally polite and nice. However, there are downsides as in customer service - this last time I've flown with them, I checked in my luggage at the counter and it arrived with a bit of the zip open - no one would actually give me a coherent answer to my claim, I was left in the hands of automatic responses, etc. Another time, having purchased my seat, I was asked to change it because they - or their algorithm - had seated separately a mother and a toddler. I said I wouldn't change it before boarding as I had paid. To my surprise, a flight attendant confronted me once again onboard, when all passengers had already been sat. That is plain rude and, once again, never got a proper answer after having filled in a complaints form). To sum up, Volotea is better than Ryanair,  but they still need to improve many things.

However, very little legroom.

These seats do not have any window and there is not enough space between these seats and the front seat. We had a baby with us who was sitting on the legs of his mother. That was scary because the free space between the baby and the front seat was less than a hand palm. We didn't have an extra scale for the back seats. There was only one scale at the front of the Airplane. My husband forgot his Polo Ralf Lauren hat which he placed on his seat. He realized it immediately when we were on the bus on the way from the plane to the arrivals. Because it was late and with the baby, it was difficult to go back to get it, so I called the next morning the lost and found department of Volotea in order to inform me how I can get the hat.

So we arrived to the airport according to the instructions and they told us that there is no more seats in the airplane.

Hasta ahora estoy muy satisfecho con la puntualidad y horarios de Volotea, por otra parte a los socios Megavolotea plus, creo que nos deberían de permitir sacar las tarjetas de embarque de ida y vuelta de inmediato y no tener que esperar 4 días antes de la salida del vuelo o tener que pagar un suplemento por elegir asientos y así nos permiten sacar las tarjetas.....no todo es recaudar.",Boeing 737,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Asturias to Malaga,June 2022,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,5.0,yes

22485,Volotea,1,"""flights are always overbooked""",29th August 2022,False," Barcelona to Lille. This was my third time flying with Volotea, and the only reason I decided to fly with them again after my previous experiences was because it was the only airline covering the route I needed. The first time I flew with Volotea everything went well. However, the second time I was not able to check in online previous to my flight. I went to the check in counter and they told me the flight was overbooked, so I got a ticket with no seat number, and they asked me to go to the boarding gate, along with 4 other people, and check if there were any available seats at the plane, giving us no guarantee at all that we would be able to fly. This time (third time), I tried to check in online 4 days before my flight (when online check in opens), and I tried several times. I always got a message saying that online check in was not available for my flight, and that I had to go to the check in desk in order to get my seat number. I called Volotea's customer support, and I contacted them on WhatsApp as well. They told me I had randomly been chosen to check in at the airport, as the webpage was overloaded (apparently it is always overloaded, as I am never able to check in online whenever I have booked flights with them). I told them about my previous experience, and said I wanted to check in online before going to the airport, but they told me they could not help me, and they said I had to go to the airport 2 hours in advance. I also asked them if the flight was overbooked, and they said they could not give me that information. I went to the airport 2h30min in advance before my flight to make sure I got a seat, being one of the first passengers to queue at the check in desks. The crew was very rude and they told me the flight was overbooked (again!), and that I did not have an allocated seat, so I had to go to the boarding gate with my standby ticket and see if there was a free seat for me. I complained and said it was not possible for me to check in online before the flight, customer support had told me I would get my allocated seat once I got to the airport 2 hours in advance, and even though I went even earlier, I did not get a seat nor a solution. I insisted I wanted to get a seat, but the people at the counter told me to either take the standby ticket or leave, as they would not give me a seat at the plane. At the boarding gate, I found out it was 4 of us again waiting to see whether or not we would be able to fly. We finally got a seat, and there were even several empty seats at the plane. I do not understand whether they do this systematically on purpose to make people suffer, or whether their flights are always overbooked. In that case, as many other (more serious) companies do, they should ask for volunteers who want to take a later flight or travel on another day, but I do not think it is normal for a company to decline the online check in for several passengers (they decide who), and even though I tried to do everything that I could to get my seat in advance, nothing worked, as I was already on their overbooking list. I have a Megavolotea membership, for which I pay yearly, but I do not really get the point of having a ""loyalty programme"" if they do not know how to treat their clients. I am very disappointed and would not recommend anybody to travel with Volotea.

At the moment of buying my ticket online, Volotea automatically (and silently) booked me a yearly subscription for this so-called ""Megavolotea"" service without any clear indication that I had to pay an extra fee additionally from my concrete flight. As avid scammers that they are, they don't highlight this fact clearly for you to realize on time and they also don't generate any cost breakdown nor any receipt for you with a global total of your transaction after you pay. You only realize that you were tricked until days later, when they book 49.99Eur from your account and then you may realize what goes on (because they don't actually send you any message about this, you have to check your banking history and start to wonder): they concealed that they deceivingly hooked a trial for a yearly subscription on your name at the moment of booking your flight so you cannot cancel it on time. Added to this, two hours before my fight departed, I find out at the check-in stand that my seat was given to someone else deliberately and that the flight is full (I had already paid for my seat several days before!). Other 5 people in that plane were in the same situation as me. I had tried to check-in online several hours before but I couldn't get my boarding pass for some reason: probably they already knew what they had done but decided to give me no notice in advance but wait that I was waiting at the airport. I had to cross the fingers that there was a non-present passenger to be able to take my flight. This is the kind of treatment after I had to pay for their special ""Megavolotea"" plan. How is it legal that they can decide to steal at any point the seat that you already paid them? you then have to bear alone the risk of being forced to travel on another day, on another plane, or to remain in a given city for an unknown time lapse?

Although these fees were paid upfront when booking, we had to pay an additional 50 euros to check in a carry-on at the boarding gate. The gate agent was very rude and had no sympathy or tried looking at our reservation to see everything we initially paid for. This company does not abide by its own bag policy and some people were let on the plane with the same size carry-on that I had. It’s very contradicting that I was able to fly into Santorini without being charged for my carryon but returning, hit with a baggage fee.

After a long wait finally the boarding time came up as 20.10hrs, but still boarding wasn't started for around half an hour later. Everyone is now sitting on board the plane luggage in overhead lockers, doors closed when an announcement is made that the staff have now been working for too many hours and the flight is cancelled!! Wouldn't they know that before we got on the plane? We are told to get off the plane and that someone on the first floor would help us. There was someone there, but they knew nothing and didn't know what to tell everyone, they soon disappeared. Every now and then a staff member would appear and the plane load of 200 plus people would converge on them demanding to know what was going on, but still they couldn't tell us anything! This went on till around 22.30hrs gradually people started slipping away as they were getting sick of waiting around they were making their own arrangements for accommodation and travel. We were told by some people who managed to speak to a staff member that they could not offer us another flight to our destination till 23/6/23 five days after we were meant to be there! Exhausted and sick of no helpful answers we gave up waiting, booked our own accommodation that night arriving there starving hungry after 2300hrs. Fortunately someone had the sense to start a WhatsApp group for passengers before people left so we could find out what other people were experiencing. Some people who stayed around and refused to leave had their accommodation that night arranged and paid for them including breakfast, but they didn't get in till around 0100hrs. That should have been offered to everyone immediately. We ended up catching a bus to Porto the next day and flying with another airline the morning after that, so we had to pay for another night's accommodation in Porto. Our travel agent has applied for a refund of our tickets, but there has been none so far 4 weeks later. I applied for EU compensation through Vueling which has been paid. I also applied to Vueling for reimbursement of our accommodation on the night of the cancellation as well as the bus we took to Porto, and the 2 nights lost accommodation in the UK as these were costs we incurred as a direct result of the flight cancellation. They have reimbursed me for the accommodation on the night of the cancellation only so am trying to recoup the rest on travel insurance. I had to supply all my receipts and boarding pass for the other airline to Vueling, I don't know why when all they paid for was the one night.

Its a budget airline, but it was a short haul direct flight from DUB to BCN, so I didn't really mind. The trouble started when my checked luggage didn't arrive at BCN. I followed the airport signage to the lost luggage desk and waited an hour, only to find that the lost luggage desk didn't serve Vueling airlines, and I had to go to another desk hidden way at the other end of the baggage area. The Vueling employee at that desk said she couldn't help me and pointed at a cardboard sign with a QR code to file your own lost luggage PIR report on your phone, assuming you have one. Spent the next day in BCN shopping for new clothes, suitcase, etc, as I had a cruise the following day. 2 days later, I get a call from DUB airport saying they found my bag and I gave them my PIR number. The next day the PIR report says my bag has been located and its on a flight to BCN and I'll be notified when it gets there. Guess what - it never arrived.  I've called almost every day and no one can help me or give me any information. Its now been over a month, well past the 21 day limit, and they are still 'reviewing my case' and I have been unable to receive any compensation for my missing luggage.

22526,Vueling Airlines,1,"""my family and I felt taken advantage of",1st July 2023,True," Unpleasant Experience with Vueling Airlines: Excessive and Unreasonable Baggage Charges and rude staff. Recent trip from Paris to La Coruña, Spain, the experience was far from the quality service one would expect from a prominent airline operating from one of the world's top tourist destinations. Upon arrival at the airport in Paris, I encountered an agent at the counter who seemed to lack proficiency in English or Spanish. Given Paris's global appeal, I was taken aback by the language barrier, which made communication and problem-solving unnecessarily difficult. My family and I (a group of 6) had already paid for three extra suitcases. Additionally, we had three carry-on bags that conformed to your airline's size specifications. However, the counter agent insisted we had to pay extra for each carry-on to take them onboard. The lack of effective communication compounded the frustration of this unexpected charge. Even when faced with the inconvenience of either losing what we had already paid for tickets or allowing our vacation to be marred, we chose to accommodate your airlines' demands. Thus, we agreed to pay an additional $150, albeit begrudgingly. However, to our utter surprise, we were informed the charges were actually double - $300 - due to a short layover in Barcelona. This seemed illogical and unfair as our final destination was La Coruña, and the stopover was not of our choosing. More so, our bags were to be checked directly to our final destination. Our attempts to discuss this discrepancy were ignored, leaving us no choice but to yield to these unjust charges. To further compound our disappointment, the carry-ons, for which we paid $300, were not allowed on the cabin with us but were handled as checked luggage. These bags contained valuable items not intended for stowage in the cargo hold and lacked the necessary locks for such handling. In summary, my family and I felt taken advantage of and robbed of an additional $300. Our journey was tainted by unwarranted stress and unjustified costs. We were left feeling helpless, with our only recourse being to write this review in hopes it may prevent future travelers from encountering similar or worse experiences. I urge Vueling Airlines to address these issues promptly and reconsider their approach to customer service, particularly communication and transparency regarding their policies.",A321,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Paris Orly to La Coruña via Barcelona,June 2023,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
22527,Vueling Airlines,2,"""undermines trust and confidence""",29th June 2023,True," The Vueling website has proven to be deceptive and misleading, offering a false sense of economy during the ticket purchasing process. This unsettling experience unfolds when customers are denied access to the cost of their hand luggage until after they have already made the payment for their ticket. To their dismay, they are then confronted with an additional charge of +45 euros for the privilege of bringing their hand luggage on board. Such practices are both disingenuous and unfair, as customers should be provided with transparent and accurate information regarding all associated costs prior to committing to a purchase. By intentionally withholding essential details until after payment, Vueling undermines the trust and confidence of its customers, tarnishing the overall experience of using their services. In an era where consumers expect honesty and integrity from companies, this unfortunate incident highlights a severe lack of transparency on Vueling's part. To foster trust and maintain a reputable image, it is crucial for businesses to prioritize open communication and upfront disclosure of all relevant fees and charges. Potential travelers must be made aware of the hidden costs of hand luggage from the outset, allowing them to make informed decisions and avoid any unpleasant surprises. By rectifying these misleading practices and adopting a more honest approach, Vueling would not only regain the trust of its customers but also ensure a more positive and respectful customer experience.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bilbao to Valencia,June 2023,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,no

With no Vueling agent available, we didn't really have much choice. Unfortunately, the office mentioned was closed. The next morning, I managed to speak to Vueling by phone (something I have since been unable to repeat). The customer services person clearly didn't believe me when I said there had been no Vueling agent available, and said she would need to email her supervisor.

The staff member took offence until I Said to her that we were waiting in the above said queue. Boarding was late, no fault of the airline or crew. Here is where it gets interesting. As soon as we boarded I needed to go to the toilet, as the terminal toilet was out of order. I asked as soon as I sat down and was told the front toilet was out of order and was told to wait until we are in the air to use the toilet at the back. Shortly after take off I saw a cabin crew member use the so called out of order toilet. To add Insult to injury the seatbelt sign was kept on way after we had levelled off. The crew were up preparing for food and drink service. As they were about to wheel the food trolley down just in front of me I asked them now a third time that I urgently needed to use the toilet. Their reply was after the meal service. I said this is the third time asking and you are doing meal service with the seatbelt sign still on.  This is obviously a strategy concocted by the crew to do uninterrupted service whilst denying paying passengers the right to use the lavatories. One crew member was forcefully telling me to wait till the sign was off. Now if there was up coming turbulence then the meal and drink service would be suspended and the seatbelt sign would come on. But, to use this strategy as trick to do their little bit of work and then chat in the galley with the curtain drawn is just unacceptable. Holding your passengers captive to satisfy efficiency comes from a poor work culture and in my book is pure laziness. To keep the the front lavatory solely for staff use is unacceptable.

This was also the first time that our son had flown and the Captain presented him with a signed certificate to mark his first flight. This was a lovely touch and was very special indeed. I liked the fact that Vueling are using BA gates at LGW and consequently the aircraft was much closer to the security area. The aircraft also used an air bridge at both ends of the journey (rare for a low cost carrier) and the cabin was equipped with individual air vents (not always seen on new aircraft nowadays).

On both occasions the initial flight has left 3 hours late and I have lost the connection for 10 minutes. Apparently due to problems with the construction of a new track in Barcelona combined with strikes by European controllers. So far, bad luck, it happens in the best families. But what defines companies and people in how they manage difficulties.  Leaving aside the flight staff, who have always been very professional, I have not been able to speak to anyone from Vueling, they have all been Iberia staff ""on loan"" to Vueling. Impossible to talk on the phone with anyone other than a machine that, based on typing options, puts you in a circle of options whose final output is to refer you to the web, never to a person. When you try the web, the experience is similar, but nobody solves the problem, just send a message and we'll see. (I'm still waiting for an answer from my first flight). Today, stuck in Barcelona, ​​I've been in 4 queues for 1 hour each, at this time I should be at home but I'm saving the 5th queue of the day, because the hotel they gave me only has one check-in person when there are 100 of us those of us who have missed the flight. The drama of all this is that I knew that I was losing the connection, then vueling too, but I imagine that the artificial intelligence that seems to manage Vueling was on Saturday and the intelligence was off.

Dejando aparte al personal de vuelo que siempre ha sido may profesional, no he podido hablar con nadie de vueling, todo han sido personal de Iberia “cedido” a vueling. Imposible hablar por telefono con nadie que no sea una maquina que a base de teclear opciones te mete en un circulo de opciones cuya salida final es remitirte a la web, nunca a una persona. 
Cuando intentas la web, la experiencia es similar , pero nadie te solventa el problema solo manda un mensaje y ya veremos.(de mi primer vuelo aun espero respuesta). Hoy, atrapado en Barcelona, llevo 4 colas cada una de 1 hora, a estas horas debería estar en mi casa pero estoy guard ado la 5a cola del día, pq el hotel a me han dado solo tiene una persona de check in cuando somos 100 los q henos perdido el vuelo. El drama de todo esto es que yo sabia que perdía la conexión, luego vueling también, pero me imagino que la inteligencia artificial que parece gestionar Vueling estaba de sabado y la inteligencia de descanso.

Then went into line once it was shorter, and when we reached the boarding gate they told us there is no space and that they sold our tickets to the people in front of us. This was the end of our trip. They then lost our bag and offered us and their customer service offered us a slight two days later which was expensive and we had to pay for. I still do not understand how this could happen - how can a business like this exist when they screw over families during their travels. We travel several times a year.

We had no information of that before the flight. If we had information we could buy a sandwich before the flight. I felt very bad, like I was going to faint, because I did not eat nothing in the morning and I was supposed to eat on board. The attitude of the cabin crew was not acceptable: 1st: they said to us that we had the info about the catering before the flight (we did no have it). 2nd: The cabin crew and the senior cabin crew were eating their meals in front of us in the galley and laughing, during this time and we had nothing to eat. 3rd: the cabin crew at the front had a friend in the flight and thy were talking every time with him loudly and laughing in the galley. This is not a good professional attitude. Moreover, the cabin crew at the back had an aggressive way to talk with passengers, he seemed bored to be here. Shame on him. Never again with Vueling for us. We like to go often to Canaria, and to Europe but we'll never take this company. We’ll take a real company with an experienced and trained crew, not this Vueling bus without crew in the cabin.

It is now two months later and they are still “searching” for our luggage. Above all we now also have to decide between either getting a claim for the lost luggage or getting a claim for the money we spend on necessities during our holidays. Not both. The amount of the claim will be based on the weight of our luggage, which is an insane way of calculating the worth of our valuable personal items.

The lady at the desk got told to off load the extra seats! We questioned this and was told by the queue supervisor that it was ok and we would keep all the seats. When we got to the boarding gate we checked again and they had no idea you could do this, one of the person's checking the tickets at the gate just turned round to her colleague and said I haven't checked anyone in, again another example of lack or good service as you could tell they didn't care and was told to check with the staff. As we boarded the plan we could see that Vueling had resold our seats. We explained to the crew that we had paid for the extra seats, not their fault but they didn't understand. We took our seats but still have lost our extra seat. The crew are trying to work it out and get and outcome to everyone's satisfaction. Then the captain came out of the cockpit and aggressively pointing at us making it clear to everyone on the plane that we had raised and issue regarding seating. After another number finger points and some none helpful words (as people do understand other languages), they decided to move the extra people to the row behind. No formal apology was given just a lot of looks and finger pointing. Just before we pulled back we were still waiting for 2 other passengers who were clearly late, but the captain made an announcement on the tannoy and clearly claimed that the very little (6 mins) delay of the plane was down to the seat problem (mainly that we had caused this problem) making it look like we had caused the problem. As soon as the late passengers turn up and sat down we were on our way, so I don't think our seat problem caused any delay. There was no visible checking of seatbelts and where bags were placed on the plane. After take off the crew the crew quickly closed of the front curtains and toilets. Such bad customer service.

The flight was at 8am, so I woke up at 5am to be at the airport with ample time. They didn’t bother to let us know; not an email, nothing. They just sent an email AT 10:24 telling us that the 8am flight was delayed — ehm, thanks, I did notice indeed that I am not flying right now. Thanks for nothing… They HAVE to, by regulation, give you reasonable food while waiting. Well, they sent an email 2h after departure time saying that you can have food via a £5 voucher. Firstly, £5 at Gatwick buys you nothing, not even a sandwich. Secondly, the email link saying in which stores you can use it was broken. And thirdly, when I actually tried to use said voucher in two stores, they said that you need to go print the boarding pass at a specific place and then have it sealed by some random people. No instructions whatsoever about this in the email. So dishonest of the airline to try that way that you do not spend YOUR ENTITLED BY REGULATION money. Finally, the flight back — I was denied boarding at the gate because I had arrived 5min after they closed the boarding.

I would love to be a fly on the wall at the strategy meetings of this venal money grabbing smug business. The whole experience is designed to get you into such a state of anxiety by bamboozling you into buying seats, insurance, extra baggage and customer care you don't need just on the off chance you are stung with exorbitant charges. They then pile on the incompetence by doing things such as sending confirmation to an entirely made up email address and not showing the baggage you have shelled out for on any of your booking information. I finally managed to get my boarding passes by having a toe in the moonlight and one burning eyebrow and promising them custody of my first born. Once inside Gatwick airport we were faced with a queue that snaked around the terminal. You then shuffle along until a panicked Vueling employee on a minimal wage calls you to skip the line as your flight is about to take off rendering the two hours you put aside for baggage check-in entirely pointless. We then had to leg it to the gate to be faced with a ""Gate Closed"" sign and absolutely nobody there. At which point my youngest burst into tears. No worries though. Vueling had simply sent the other 200 or so passengers to the wrong gate. Result. Next stroke of luck, we were not thrown off the flight due to overbooking seats.

I don't memorize these numbers so I asked him to wait while I find it. He graciously waited 30 seconds. 30 seconds of waiting and then he tells me that if I don't have the number then he will have to hang up in order to serve other customers. After saying that, he doesn't wait for my response, tells me to kindly do a survey, and hangs up the phone. I understand that there are other customers, I understand that there will be other people calling this airline to find out about their friends or family that were on the same flight as my cousin but I cannot believe that 30 seconds was too much of a wait time.

The hostesses tell me that the ticket shows my first name repeated two times (name/name) not my first and last name. Although I paid for it with my credit card there is nothing to do for the company. I can only change the name by spending 500 euros, or buy a new ticket for 400 euros. I am ready to go, I have already paid for the hotel so I choose to buy a new ticket. I pay 490 euros, the hostesses tell me that it is the same return ticket like the first one, and they tell me to rush towards the boarding area. at the Gate the hostesses assure me again that the ticket is round trip and that I will receive the rest of tags once in Spain. But in Spain I will have a nasty surprise. the connection Barcelona to Las Palmas is overbooked and I will be boarded by a miracle and as last Passenger despite being the owner of two seats on that plane! After two days spent on the phone trying to talk to someone from Vueling, I discover that the replacement ticket sold to me at the check in in Rome is one way ticket! Ruined vacation for the first two days and uncertain mood for the remaining days looking for a return flight that wasn't too expensive. Total cost 1000 euros only for the flights of the Vueling; an additional hotel day + airport parking + lunch, dinner + airport lunch + extra = 150 euros. In total 750 euros more spent. 750 euros that I could have saved or spent to better enjoy the holiday. I could also have had a calmer, more relaxed attitude. For me Vueling is the worst airline in the world based on my experience. I have never had such a bad and depressing experience with an airline. They don't even give you a glass of water on board.

22595,Vueling Airlines,1,"""amazingly bad customer service""",25th April 2022,True,"  My recent flight with Vueling was the worst flying experience of my life. I paid £795 for 2 adults and a child to fly one-way from Rome to Gatwick. This is a lot of money for such a terrible service.  We paid extra for row 3 ""More space plus"" - this includes extra luggage allowance in the overhead bin & priority boarding. The priority boarding just didn't happen. As a result, we boarded about halfway through the process, and as we joined, every single overhead locker was full until row 10. However, on closer inspection, around 1/3 of these bags did not have yellow ""approved"" overhead locker tags on them, they were just the bags that should be stowed under the seat, but lazy passengers had just stored them in the bins. There was no monitoring or policing of the bin policy by any of the cabin crew, so this led to huge amounts of aggravation from all the passengers (like me) who had paid £30 extra for overhead luggage storage but now could not access it. The cabin crew were lazy, rude and surly.  The 4 cabin crew ""hid"" behind their curtain at the front of the plane for the majority of the flight, laughing and giggling and ignored their customers for at least 75% of the journey. When passengers tried to access the front of the plane, the cabin crew held the curtain closed so the passengers couldn't get in. The food and beverage service started 25 minutes after the seatbelt lights had gone off.  I was in Row 3, the crisps/snacks had already run out before they even got to me. The crew stopped people from using the front toilet (even when the light was green and the toilet was unoccupied), sending them to the back of the plane.  It was truly amazingly bad customer service.

Received one text message acknowledging our PIR number. Checking online shows that they are searching for our bags. Calling in to Vueling is a horrible experience. I could only find a human by mistake on the phone tree. The agent was the worst I have ever encountered. She would only tell me that the bags were not found yet.

When I entered the plane, it turned out that all overhead compartments in the front are full. It looked like most of the luggage belonged to the crew. The crew told me in a very arrogant way to store my hand luggage in the rear of the cabin (my seat was in the front row). Second, for most of the flight all the crew stayed in the front galley, giggling and chatting. They stowed the curtain, and closed the front lavatory to keep privacy. Lastly, the disembarkment was a mess. Okay, they announced that because of Covid passengers must leave the aircraft row by a row. But they didn’t care how the disembarkment actually looked like.

22598,Vueling Airlines,1,"""the worst customer service""",29th March 2022,True,"  Vueling may have the worst customer service of any airline. I booked my flight incredibly carefully at Vueling.com, only to arrive at a confirmation page that had me flying on a totally different route than I had selected with a totally different time (like completely different origin and destination city and not even the same day). There was clearly a glitch with the booking, and I tried to contact Vueling call center only to find it closed. When I called back a few hours later and their call center was open, they refused to cancel or refund my reservation since ""no website incident was documented"" and since it had been more than 2 hours since I booked the flight. They did not care that their call center was closed which made it impossible to reach them within 2 hours of booking online. I am now out about 100 Euros because of a stupid glitch on Vueling's website which they refuse to acknowledge or offer support around. They claim I had to contact them within 2 hours of the booking (a ridiculously short window of time) despite the fact that their call center was closed within the 2 hour window. The only ""solution"" they offer you is to file a complaint on their website, which is literally a chat bot.

I bought a combination ticket, so it wasn’t an option or explained that you had to pay extra for cabin luggage if at all there is that option. And not cheap either! I ended up having to check in my cabin baggage twice, so in the end this airline isn’t even cheaper. The check in literally took me hours because it didn’t accept the reservation code and the customer service doesn’t respond and reverts you back into the loop of not being able to contact Vueling directly. When arriving at the airport it took me another hour check in as there were hundreds of people and only 4 counters - ridiculous.

When CSD had an issue with documents they need to validate so that I could check-in online, and indicated something ""may be missing"", CSD did not state what was missing, even when I asked - then I received email saying Vueling ""could not validate [my] documents"" and I was not able to check-in online. On my outward flight, after I reached my destination, I received an email from CSD offering their ""most sincere apologies"" for inadequate service. For my return flight, my experience of the outward flight with CSD was repeated almost identically: CSD had an issue with the documents I had uploaded, and sent me an email saying I needed a PCR test to return to France, which for persons fully vaccinated (my case) does not figure among the requirements of the French authorities (nor in the list of requirements for France on the Vueling site) - I emailed CSD again (3 times), never receiving any reply - then I received an email saying Vueling ""could not validate my documents"" and I was not able to check-in online. When I checked-in in person, the Vueling agent handed me my boarding-pass on both occasions, in 30 seconds - and everything was hassle-free on the flights themselves. As a result of this experience, I decided to complain to Vueling and, to that end, I prepared a 4-page summary of my CSD experience - in order to avoid any repetition, I wanted to try at least to discover why CSD had not validated my documents in both directions. However, like the above, the CSD complaints procedure permitted areas of complaint are limited to  ""language"" (that used to communicate with CSD), and ""waiting time"" (how long before CSD replies to the queries from customers). In the free text box (""your query""), one can outline one's complaint but not at any great length. There is no possibility to send a document or any type of file as an attachment to the complaint. CSD does not acknowledge receipt of the complaint, not even with an automated standard message, which means that I have no record of having made my complaint, and no copy of its content. I am left with the impression that Vueling, once the customer has paid for the flight, feels it is free to do whatever it wants (change the flight, impose a credit rather than refund in case of cancellation), and not do what it should do (answer emails, explain document validation decisions, provide an adequate complaint system, enable customers to speak to a Vueling agent), a total lack of respect for the customer.",A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Rome to Paris,October 2021,1.0,1.0,,3.0,,,1.0,no

At the check-in that we couldn't complete online we had to wait forty minutes. One of the employees wasn't very focused and got confused with our luggage as well as the boarding passes/passports. We did not know one has to buy the food/drinks. All staff spoke a lot of Spanish and avoided the contact with the passengers as much as possible. One stewardess was so rude that even passengers next to us complained. You can only pay with credit card - no other paying method is available. The staff didn't distribute water for several hours and said that we had to go back and ask them. Earpods weren't included  and cost 3 Dollars a pack.  The tv program didn't offer a wide range of programs and my touchscreen hardly reacted.

I booked through Norwegian and the flights were operated by Wamos. I'll never make the mistake of ignoring that again. To begin with, the seats are massively uncomfortable. I wasn't expecting luxury, but I could actually feel how the plastic fit together through the seat cover on this flight. Additionally, the cost of food was $45, so I chose not to order food, opting instead to bring snacks on the plane. Both flights I took were transatlantic, so around 8-9 hours. If you had not paid for food, they would not allow you to have even water. actually saw the flight attendants laugh in other passengers' faces when they asked for a cup of water on an 8+ hour flight! One of these flights didn't even allow passengers a chance to purchase snacks or drinks, either. The gate agents weighed passengers carry-on baggage when they felt like it (in other words, arbitrarily), so some people with overweight luggage were allowed on regardless of weight, while others had to pay £80 to check their luggage at the gate. My flight from London to Chicago took off over 2 and a half hours late and nearly caused me to miss my next flight. The crew were in no rush to help passengers move quickly off the plane, even knowing that there were people with layovers who would now need to make connecting flights with drastically less time (including going through customs, awaiting baggage, transferring to domestic terminals, and going through security again.) I would rather pay a massive last-minute ticket price than ever ride with this airline again and if I ever find myself in a position to fly with them again, I would either spend the money for a different airline, or just stay home.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Gatwick to Chicago,July 2019,1.0,1.0,,1.0,2.0,,1.0,no
22618,Wamos Air,1,"""Would not recommend Wamos""",3rd January 2019,True,"  Denver to Gatwick. Wamos Air was used by Norwegian Air during my trip home to the UK in December. They contacted me by e mail informing me of this change. I was rather annoyed as I had flown Norwegian in the Summer as was very pleased with the service. I called Norwegian whose agent assured me it would be exactly the same service including my seat reservation and ordered vegetarian meal. The flight out from Denver was ok, despite my vegetarian meal being some inedible dried up pasta dish. Breakfast was a barely thawed hard bread mozzarella sandwich. There were no TV'S in the seats and one had to log on onto Wamos Air which I was not prepared to do as I only had Cellphone and did not want to use my batteries. In the return journey to Denver the flight was delayed by half an hour. In both directions I was placed in a middle seat not an aisle seat as booked. One lady was kind enough to swap with me. Fortunately on the way back the aisle seat next to me was vacant. By moving one seat over and informing the flight attendants I had done this, must have caused great confusion for them. I did not receive my vegetarian meal at all. I asked three times to various attendants which proved quite annoying to them regarding their passive aggressive facial expressions. Finally they told me they had run out of vegetarian hot lunches and brought me a cheese sandwich and a free beer, probably to appease me. I was not at all complaining at the time but their general attitude towards me was aloof and unfriendly. I went to the galley to ask for a cup of tea x interrupting three attendants happily chatting away in Spanish. I wondered why they could not have such cheery dispositions towards the passengers. One girl very much put out it appeared, gave me a cup of tea. The annoyance on her face was very apparent. I am shocked that a reputable good airline such as Norwegian would contract such a sub standard company to replace them. I paid my money and it was not that cheap for a service that made my journey uncomfortable and unfriendly. I have read other negative reviews of Wamos Air, so I am joining the throng of a large number number of very dissatisfied customers. Would not recommend Wamos to anyone.

I've had worse legroom on other flights, and the staff were more friendly and helpful than many others I've known (and I fly a lot). The plane was pretty old, but perfectly functional.

They replaced their plane with one from Wamos at the last minuter. Everything you read on Wamos is true: probably the worst airline I have flown with. The only good thing I could say about them is that the plane was clean, and the staff was courteous (most of them). Everything else needs a red flag. No electric or USB plugs for your devices, no entertainment monitors: you have to use your own tablet or device by downloading their app before taking off and connecting to their network, which means if you don't have any of these devices or if you are an older person who has a hard time with the new tech, you're sidelined and have no movie for the whole flight (12 hours sitting in a tight seat doing nothing is a long time). Not even mentioning if your computer is not compatible with their app (that was my case). I had to watch their programs on my small iPhone. And the connectivity/functionality of their app is appalling: if you have to rewind even once, good luck! Now, regarding their entertainment program: 10 old movies, nothing else. I had seen most of them, and the ones I had not seen sucked. Finally, about a major matter on a plane: the food. Norwegian is a low-cost airline that makes it confusing by having to pre-order your meals when you book your ticket. But the thing is, it's kind of really not clear, and when you book your ticket, you tend to automatically assume that meals are included. I pre-ordered mine without knowing . But many people don't. The next available option is to purchase on the plane, but they only sell food to the other passengers way after they serve the pre-ordered meals, and it takes for ever, because of how many passengers are in that situation.

",18th July 2018,True," JFK- London (Wamos Air, operated for Norwegian). This was easily the worst experience I've ever had on an airplane, and I've been around the block for a while. Whilst the two hour delay can be excused, there was little understanding for the lack of any form of customer services. There were no screens/entertainment devices (which for an 8h flight is understandably frustrating) and no service whatsoever (as in, no food or drinks). When I asked for water for the 3rd time, I was supplied with a 1/4 cup of brown-ish water, that certainly did not taste right. The stewardesses did not provide any helpful services and spent most of the flight talking to each other. Most members of staff were rude and did not accommodate any of the request of my fellow travelers. Do not get me started on the airplane itself - the seats were as uncomfortable as they get, and small. The air conditioning did not work and it was stuffy and hot throughout the entire flight. Again, for an 8 hour flight that is just not bearable. I advise to not ever fly with Wamos Air

The 400 series of Dash8 is noise regulated so inside, the propeller noise were not that bad and loud. Flying on short 50 minute flights you get a coffee. You just have enough time to drink that coffee and then they'll come and collect your waste. Landed before ETA, and left on time. The pilots also talked during the flight which can help people who are maybe a bit afraid to fly.

22645,Wideroe,9,Wideroe customer review,24th March 2015,False,Booked whole itinerary from their website; flew Wideroe from Kirkesnes to Batsfjord return with two very short layovers. Good cabin crew with smiles safety features and cockpit announcements both in Norwegian and in English. Leather seats seat pitch varies free choice of seat. Buy on board menu and a toilet use for short flights only when plane is landed for a 15 min layover according to flight schedule. All in all professional flight experience. Also security checks in the airport made me feel comfortable and were handled professionally. Make sure that you book all flights to one itinerary as there might be cancellations due to bad weather in Northern Norway. Wideroe will then rebook you to next day flight and provide an accommodation.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,0.0,,0.0,,4.0,yes
22646,Wideroe,1,Wideroe customer review,21st April 2014,False,I travelled with Wideroe from Bergen airport in Norway to Aberdeen on 16th April 2014. The check-in is managed by SAS and was very swift and efficient. The check-in staff were very pleasant and welcoming and made small talk which was a nice start to my journey. Wideroe use a Dash aircraft on this relatively short flight across the North Sea to Scotland. The gate staff were very efficient and this was more than matched by 2 superb cabin crew members who worked very hard and offered tea and coffee and a small snack in the form of a muffin. The seats were very comfortable. The downside for me is that my seat appeared to have been changed from the seat I had picked online. I ended up next to the engines and as a result I could not see much. The interior of the aircraft was spotlessly clean and good information was given during the flight. I will certainly consider using this airline again in the future.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,,0.0,,3.0,yes

My flight (40 min) was a part of a seven-leg evening journey from Bodø to Vadsø in bad weather conditions. Aircraft arrived to Stokmarknes already with 40-minute delay. The only flight attendant was absolutely the frendliest one I've ever met - her smile and attitude made everybody forget about the delay. Pilots excused for the delay twice. As warm mineral water was inaccessible in the trolley FA gave me her own. To sum up: very cosy atmosphere on board. Widerøe is the only significant regional carrier in Norway but does its best to satisfy passengers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
22649,Wideroe,n,Wideroe customer review,9th October 2006,False,"Tromsø to Kirkenes via Vadsø and Vardø was a funny experience. Dash 8-100 with 37 seats was occupied with 24 passengers for the first leg. Flight attendant was very charming and smiling at every passenger while announcing and demonstrating the security equipment (well on this plane there was no place for her to hide). Short after take off she prepared her little trolley in front of the cabin and then started the ""food for purchase"" service as usual on Widerøe. Bought a reindeer (!) sandwich and a coke which was an adquate snack. 20 of the passengers left in Vadsø and we had a 30 min stop. Before we continued we were asked if we would like to see the security information once again. Nobody had a need for this and so we departed. The 15 min hop to Vardø was beautiful because we did fly just a some hundred foot above the ground and the sights were spectacular. The other three passengers left the aircraft in Vardø and another passenger joined us. So we were two for the hop to Kirkenes and we got a very personal security briefing which was different from the usual standard phrases. ""Don't get shocked if it seems that the life vest strangulates you. That's because you should not slip out"". Hop to Kirkenes was 20 min and the farewell was the most personal I ever received on an air trip.",,,,,,,,,,,,,no

Traveled from Copenhagen to Torp but because of fog and missing cabincrew (caused by the fog) the plane was 2 hours late but so were all other planes too.

The online booking system is beyond flawed - if you have 3 people with the same first name but different middle names and dates of birth, because the system doesn't provide a field for middle name input, upon checkin, you'll have problems checking in, system the computer thinks you're trying to check int he same person 3 times. The ability to use credit vouchers is beyond non-existent. First, they never email you the credit vouchers, you have to remember and call their customer service to request for those to be emailed to you. Once they email you a book of ""credit vouchers"", you cannot use them online, you have to book, select to pay later, and then call their customer service to ask them to use the credit vouchers. Their business model is to get you to buy tickets and never receive any money back, even if you buy their supposedly ""refundable"" tickets.

I arrived at airport more than 2 hours before, then was told that we had to complete an electronic immigration and health form before being allowed to board (no one flying was aware of this requirement prior to flying). After filing, I had to receive a confirmation from St. Kitts authorities via email. There was no notice of this when booking the flight, nor follow-up via email 24 hours before checking in. In my mind, I thought that I will be IN transit, and would only need to do the regular paper filings and show my vaccination card and recent test results, if necessary. Anyway, on completing the tiresome form, which was laborious, had questions with no relevance, and hard to navigate, I waited half an hour with no response from St. Kitts in my inbox. I then went to my spam folder to find an odd query from St. Kitts, telling me to refile. Tried to refile, but couldn't get back into their system, because of course, they were still processing my initial filing. Long story short, I missed the flight, had to purchase a ticket on JetBlue, fly to New York, then fly down to Puerto Rico. And the end result?

In fact all of the flights the day of our return were cancelled. We were then told we had been rebooked on a flight 2 days earlier than planned. Winair stole 2 days from our vacation which we had been planning on for over a year. We then had to pay additional expenses of $850 to stay in St. Maarteen.

22657,Winair,1,"""Winair is the worst company""",21st January 2019,True,"  Winair, the company of shame! I travel around the world often and Winair is the worst company I have ever taken. I made two trips from France to St. Barth, with three flights in all (Pau / Paris, Paris / Saint-Martin and Saint-Martin / Saint-Barth). These flights cost 1500 euros. On two occasions, I could not take the flight between St. Martin and St. Barth when I arrived on time from Paris. The reason? The poor organization and incompetence of the Winair staff. The first time, I had a ticket ""Standby"". We were many passengers waiting in the heat in a large hall. The hour of our flight had arrived and we had no information. After a while, they called passengers for St. Barts and people rushed and pushed for a place. Many people could not fly, and we were told that there would be no more flights to St. Barts. We then wanted to get out of the airport to go to the boat, but we were stuck in the airport. Finally, we were able to leave an hour later, and the taxi had to drive very fast to arrive on time to take the boat. I had to pay 20 euros for a taxi and 90 euros for a boat. The sea was very bad and I was very sick on the boat because of the sea and fatigue. I was up since 3am (French time) and I was traveling since 20H. When I arrived in St. Barth I had to wait another hour at the customs, and I did not have my car to go home because I left it at the airport. The second time, I encountered exactly the same problem. But besides, I had a problem with my luggage. The lady of Winair (the only one who speaks French) said that the luggage had gone to St. Barts, and that we could go take the boat. I asked if she was sure of herself, and she said yes. I had a bad feeling and looked for my suitcase in the mess of the airport. Finally, after 30 minutes, I found my suitcase in the airport, all wet. I opened it and inside everything was wet: computer equipment, clothes. If I had listened to the lady of Winair, my luggage would have remained abandoned in this state at the airport. A shame ! In the end, in addition to my two trips that cost me 3000 euros in total, I had to pay 250 euros more for the taxi and the boat. In the end, in addition to my two trips that cost me 3000 euros in total, I had to pay 250 euros more for the taxi and the boat. They give no information to the passengers. When asked a question, they do not answer. They are unpleasant and give the impression that they are annoyed, while as a customer I have always been polite to them. They do not respond to emails to the email address of their site. - If you finally get the personal customer service mails, they give the impression that you bother and respond aggressively. They say the tickets have not been bought on their site so they will not refund you. They make no commercial gesture for you. They do not take their problems.

When I booked the flight it was supposed to be San Juan-St Maarten to St. Kitts. Later Winair changed it to San Juan-St Maarten- Nevis -St. Kitts. In SJ airport they charged $47 for an extra bag, and then again $65 for the same extra bag at St Marteen. One bag was received two days after the trip, and the 2nd bag, 3 days after the trip. None of the bags were delivered to my hotel I had to pay 3 round trip taxi trips to the airport. One on 1/7 because they would never answer the phone, just to find out when my luggage will arrive, which they did not know. Then on 1/8 to pick up the first bag, which was all wet, inside and out. Then on 1/9 to pick up the second bag. The second bag had perishables which I lost. They new there were perishables there since 1/6 and when I filled for the delayed bag on 1/6 but did not make a little effort to move that bag from St. Maarten to St. Kitts until after 3 days.

For this destination the airline scheduled a long layover in Bogota. A few days before our flight, Wingo cancelled the Bogota-Caracas portion saying the airline was prevented from flying from Bogota into Venezuela. According to Wingo, this was a force majeure case. This is in no way a force majeure case. When the airline sold me the tickets they knew they were not allowed to flight from Bogota to Caracas while other direct flights from Mexico to Caracas were allowed. The airline tried everything to keep our money and escape liability. It wanted us to take the Cancun-Bogota fligh (because that one was not cancelled), leave us there and reimburse only the Bogota-Caracas portion. When we asked for a full refund to buy the tickets from another airline and be able to go to our destination, they refused saying that they were not responsible for us not being able to enter the country. We are Venezuelan citizens and at that time we were not prevented from entering into Venezuela neither due to the Covid-19 pandemic nor by any other reason. If you know that you cannot flight to a destination, you shouldn't be selling tickets to that destination with the plan to leave the passangers stranded in the layover location. The airline knew it was not going to be able to fulfill the contract as it was entered into and the customer should not be penalized for the airline's short sigh, bad planning or plain shady procedures.

Ground service offered the Cuban visa before taking off. I found this a very good quota of service. The flight day I was surprised for them to be so punctual. We started the itinerary on time, arriving at Havana's airport earlier than expected. The seats were really comfortable considering that it is a low-cost airline, comfy legroom plus good in-flight service. They offer a menu with many options to eat in flight, and I consider they have really good prices, and they can get cheaper if you can pay in Colombian Peso due to the exchange tax.

The night before our flight we did check in on Wingo website and again read carefully everything about the process. In the morning when we came to give our bags and we were informed that we must have a printed tickets (wasn't mentioned no where) and a print screen shot in the phone is not acceptable. Apparently they are the only company that a phone screen shot of the tickets does'nt work in the check point to the security. We had to pay Wingo just for a simple print of paper 600 Mexican peso which is about 30 euro. So rude! Of course, there was nowhere in the airport a place with a printing machine so we had to pay this rip-off. Besides us, there was another couple who had the same story. After arriving in Colombia we went to their customer service in the airport to complain, we demanded to see where was it written that we need to print the tickets, the girls who worked there couldn't find this as well and told us to send an official complaint to the company website. We did, the company refused to compensate us with out a reasonable explanation. Bottom line I think this is just a way to rip people of, very disappointed.

We travelled from Bali to Sumbawa Besar via Lombok on Tuesday 19/7/16 and made the return trip on Friday 29/7/16. In summary of our experience do not fly Wings Air to get to your destination, particularly if you are a surfer. Cost for surfboards. The cost is Rp 200 000 per surfboard per flight. This means that flying from Bali to Sumbawa, which entailed two flights connecting in Lombok, cost Rp400 000 per board each way. We could not find this information anywhere on the Wings Air/Lion Air website, which of course would have informed our choice of airline. The Wings Air employee at check-in at Denpasar told us that the cost is indeed not on their website. Treatment of checked in surfboards - My brother paid Rp 1 200 000 for three surfboards from Sumbawa Besar via Lombok to Bali. His board case was left in Lombok and involved considerable time and hassle to get back in Bali. I paid Rp 800 000 for two surfboards from Sumbawa Besar via Lombok to Bali. One of my boards arrived with damage. Communication - We first attempted to travel from Bali to Sumbawa Besar on Monday 18/7/16. There were legitimate reasons for flights to be delayed that day – some repairs were being made to the runway. The level of frustration and angst at the gates being used by Wings Air was fuelled by a lack of communication and miscommunication. After several hours of seeking information, we were told that our 3pm flight would leave at 6.45pm. We sought confirmation of this on a further four occasions as we were keen to not miss our flight. When 6:45pm came we went to the gate to check what was happening to be told that our flight (and our surfboards) had already left at 5.10pm. A number of other passengers were also left stranded by this action. We went to the Wings Air/Lion Air office to work out how we could now get to Sumbawa Besar, and how we could ensure the security of our four surf bags with 11 surf boards. We were amazed to find that Wings Air tried to make us pay for new flights as we had “failed to turn up to the gate” for our flight (even though we were only sitting 10m away, having been assured again that our flight would not leave until 6.45pm).",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,DPS to SWQ via LOP,July 2016,3.0,3.0,,1.0,,,1.0,no

Experience for Dammam to Abu Dhabi for 23/6/2023 - Check-in was over the counter at the airport. Flight got delayed by almost 2 hrs and nobody knew what was the reason. No complimentary refreshment was given even after this huge time delay. I missed my connecting bus and reached my hotel very late at midnight due to this delay. Experience for Abu Dhabi to Dammam for 30/6/2023 - Now this is the real deal. When we reached the airport for check-in we were informed that we have online check-in option during booking. So they will charge to do check-in at the airport. That charge is almost 2 times of the cost of ticket. Wow! By the way, they will put every details like food choice, weight limits along with all useless info in ticket but they will never mention compulsory web check-in option in ticket and charges for not complying it. Also they are so caring to send you useless mail before departure to remind you to check about destination visa but never remind you to do web check-in which is only option as per their understanding and its penalty. This strategy was used to loot almost 10 more passengers who were there on the same flight. They were also cheated in the same manner and they seemed really upset which spoiled their vacation.

My sister and I were traveling from Abu Dhabi to Antalya on an early Saturday morning. We each had one free carry-on bag, which we placed under our seats. After checking in, we proceeded to gate 17 for departure. However at the departure gate, we were informed that the flight's cabin baggage capacity was full, and they asked us to leave our carry-on bags there. They gave us tags and assured us we could collect our bags from the airport belt later. Since we only had our carry-on bags with us, my sister and I had packed everything essential, including clothes, undergarments, makeup, toiletries, footwear, and my tablet in those bags. Upon arriving at Antalya Airport, we were dismayed to find that our bags were not on the belt. We immediately filed a complaint, but the response from the complain center was that our bags were still in Abu Dhabi; they hadn't been loaded onto the plane. Now, my sister and I are left with only our small cross bags, containing just our passports and money. We have nothing else to wear or use. Our plan was to continue from Antalya to Trabzon, but without our bags, that seem to be impossible. What was supposed to be a mini-vacation has turned into a nightmarish experience all because of Wizz Air's mishandling of our baggage.

It was a nightmare, we had to protest to be checked in. That is within the standard two hours before departure. We asked what is the option, they said i had to take the luggage with me at the gate and pay extra for the luggage. Then they verified again our tickets and perhaps they saw that we paid additional fees for additional luggage and they finally checked us in. Then as we went at the gate we had to endure more than an hour for the luggage to be verified for size, and there was a huge line with people corralled like cattle with no option to sit or even use toilet as you would be afraid you'd lose your place in that que. We had to wait a lot to get through there were people with luggage that were made to paid extra. After an ordeal of waiting like cattle standing and being slowly marched through to check luggage size, we were further corralled towards the embarking gate, and after another about 40 min we were marched towards the plane by foot.

Firstly, during the booking process, I was bombarded with various hidden fees. What appeared to be a reasonably priced ticket quickly turned into a financial burden.

When I tried getting help from the Live Chat Agent, I was told to buy a ticket and request name change, and it implied you just change the name and that is it. For each chat with the Agent, you have to provide your details, like the booking number and account email address, so that they know who exactly is requesting support. I did buy the ticket, and the same agent has informed me that in order to change the name on the booking I will have to pay the fee. Right after letting me know the agent left the chat. So, you have no chance to buy a ticket for someone else from your account, and the airline is telling you to do things, you will have to pay for.

Unfortunately my happiness transformed to a distaste soon enough. Had to cancel my trip due to the fact my wife was diagnosed this week with a medical problem that needed immediate attention making us cancel our whole Euro trip due to various doctors visits. Anyway calling WizzAir told us the cancellation fee is 80% or the cost of the tickets, if I have to change dates is about 65% of the original ticket costs. They have no travel voucher to offer to be used later as I asked I need no money back. They offered to “negotiate” the cancellation cost of the ticket if we can provide doctor’s records resulting that my wife cannot travel, this is outrageous as medical records are confidential. Seems that letter from my family doctor was not good enough.

This scathing review serves as a warning to fellow travelers who value their time, money, and overall peace of mind. Brace yourself for a tale of incompetence, broken promises, and an utter lack of customer care. Let's begin with the initial offense: the cancellation of our flight without any plausible reason. We got an email the morning of our departure so we rushed to the airport to get some clarity only to be informed that your flight has been abruptly scrapped. Shockingly, Wizz Air failed to provide any legitimate explanation for this cancellation, leaving passengers bewildered and stranded without any clue as to what transpired behind the scenes. Additionally, they didn't have an option for both me and my partner to fly out until 3 days later which wouldn't work because of our work schedules. In a desperate bid for assistance, I reached out to Wizz Air's customer service while at the Palma airport. Little did I know that I was about to embark on an infuriating journey of unhelpful agents and contradictory statements. Despite assuring us that we would be reimbursed if we chose to book an alternative flight outside their company, this turned out to be nothing more than a hollow promise. They had no intention of honoring their commitment, leaving us in a state of financial uncertainty and deep disappointment. Refusing to give up, we sought professional help from an external company, hoping they could navigate the treacherous waters of Wizz Air's reimbursement process. Unfortunately, this only added insult to injury. Nine long and arduous months later, we are still fighting for the reimbursement we rightfully deserve. It is inconceivable that an airline, claiming to value its customers, could display such a blatant disregard for their responsibilities. Wizz Air's inability to provide a backup flight for three days highlights their lack of contingency planning and their disregard for the inconvenience caused to their passengers. Furthermore, their callousness in denying our rightful claim and subsequent inability to fulfill their obligations demonstrates a disturbing level of unprofessionalism and an alarming lack of transparency. Traveling should be an enjoyable and stress-free experience, yet Wizz Air has turned it into a nightmare. Their cancellation without reason, broken promises, and refusal to reimburse the amount we paid for an alternative flight have left us feeling betrayed and disillusioned. It is my sincere hope that this review will serve as a cautionary tale to potential passengers considering Wizz Air, urging them to explore alternative options and spare themselves the agony we endured. In conclusion, I strongly advise against choosing Wizz Air for your travel needs. Their lack of accountability, unreliable service, and poor customer care make them an airline that should be avoided at all costs.

22737,Wizz Air,1,"""No customer service""",19th June 2023,True,"  So, upon arriving 3 hours prior to my flight, it was already delayed by 2 hours.  But it was then moved again another hour, then cancelled. We were told to go to the flight desk, with many other wizz air flights. But at the flight help desk, there was no-one there. No member of staff knew what was going on. We then got told to go to gate 12. So did other flights to different locations.  Not blaming the staff, they had no idea what was going on just like us. No customer service, no information as to why it was all cancelled. As flights to Spain from Wizz still went ahead but Portugal and other Spain flights (from other customers) were cancelled?

22739,Wizz Air,3,"""avoid this company""",17th June 2023,True,"  I think it's misleading to call this a low-fare. It was nothing but. The first indication of a campy ticket was when booking the tickets for two families I added one large (20kg) suitcase to each family. to my surprise, the cost of adding the luggage was per leg and stood at a whopping $130 per leg, per suitcase. In total, I paid $270 for the suitcase. For comparison, the ticket was $162. Additionally, the advertised ticket price changed while I was in the middle of the booking process and jumped by $20 per passenger. So a projected $140 ticket (already pricey for a 37min. flight!) actually climbed to $252 (in a family of 3). This didn't include advanced check in cost, seat selection cost, and other money grabbing options. But the real shocker was upon return. We got to the ticket counter and expected to drop our luggage and get our boarding passes when we were informed unceremoniously that we needed to pay another 50 Euro per person to be checked in. This happened despite the fact that no such fees were asked for on the way from TLV to Larnaca. The ground team threatened to deny our boarding unless we paid. The confirmation email btw only mentioned that ""If possible, always check in online before leaving for the airport. Otherwise, you might have to pay a fee at the airport."" - no clear language there whatsoever. Nothing in red, no advanced warning via email or sms. only an automated response from the check in rep. The supervisor wasn't offering any help either. We had to run to the other side of the terminal, pay the fees, then run all the way to the gate (threatened with a closed gate) only to be left waiting for the bus to the plane another 20 minutes in a small hall with no AC. Finally, a 20min. delay while on the plane is almost always complementary. The final ticket price then jumped to a little over $300, a truly low-low-fare experience for the price of a full-fare flight. I'd say that unless you're traveling alone, with a small backpack, and have all the time in the world, avoid this company at all cost.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,TeAviv to Larnaca,June 2023,2.0,4.0,,2.0,,,2.0,no

Some people waited in the spot that the sign said for priority but they were ignored. So they pushed past the line of everyone else and the gate agent helped them next. Which meant the rest of us with priority were left wondering if we should do the same? Chances are half of us had priority and it would feel fair to cut in line because of that. When I asked about where priority was supposed to have been as I was boarding, the lady just shrugged with an exasperated look. It was the most clown show boarding I’ve ever seen. Luckily there was still overhead space but I imagine many priority passengers had a hard time finding space. It shouldn’t be hard to make an announcement to explain what to do.

It's been almost half a year now of this battle, with my emails being responded to on average after 3 weeks whereas when I sent one of my responses after 3 days, I was threatened with Wizzair closing the case.

Humiliating treatment. It cannot be understood that people who work in front of the public treat people so badly. We did not know that we had to do the check in online. When making the reservation, select an option for which a higher amount was paid but the bags could be checked in. As in most companies, I took it for granted that when you checked in your suitcase, they gave you your boarding pass at the counter, which was bad on my part, we should have been informed and we assumed that the mistake is ours. We had to pay €45 each, €90 in total, but although this is a significant expense for us, the displeasure was the treatment received by the employees, they spoke to us and treated us without respect and laughing. I recommend people fly with any other company, respect and education are being lost.  Trato humillante. No se puede entender que personas que trabajan de cara al público traten tan mal a la gente. No sabíamos que había que hacer el c/in on line. Al hacer la reserva seleccione una opción por la que se pagaba un importe mayor pero se podían facturar las maletas. Como en la mayoría de las compañías, di por hecho que al facturar la maleta te daban la tarjeta de embarque en el mostrador, mal por mi parte, deberíamos habernos informado y asumimos que el error es nuestro. Tuvimos que pagar 45€ cada uno, 90€ en total, pero aunque para nosotros esto supone un gasto importante, el disgusto fue el trato recibido por los empleados, nos hablaron y trataron sin respeto y entre risas.

I paid for a 10kg bag when I bought my ticket but when boarding, I was made to pay 40 euros extra because supposedly the bag must be registered and must go in the hold even though it is cabin baggage. I have never seen such a thing, even the other low-cost companies do not have this policy. When I paid the 40 euros, there they did not find a problem with my luggage, this is clearly a scam. They try to extract money from customers by all means. On top of that, the flight was delayed for more than an hour and a half. Pire expérience avec une compagnie low-cost. J'ai payé un bagage de 10kg quand j'ai acheté mon billet mais au moment de l'embarquement, on m'a fait payé 40 euros supplémentaires car soit-disant le bagage doit être enregistré et doit passer en soute alors qu'il s'agit d'un bagage cabine. Je n'ai jamais vu de tel. Même les autres compagnies low-cost n'ont pas cette politique. Quand j'ai payé les 40 euros, là ils n'ont pas trouvé de problème avec mon bagage.

First of all the check in was a disgrace. We waited in line for nearly 2 hrs and nearly missed our flight because of the check in delays. Furthermore, my bags were checked in under another passengers name (luckily as one of friends). This wasn't the end of it! Upon arriving in Lyon airport, it turns out that Wizz hadn't bothered to put at least 30 pieces of luggage onto the flight so left my luggage in Gatwick (along with around 20 other passengers' luggage). This meant I was on a ski trip with only the contents of my rucksack. The process of getting my bags back has been a disaster. Firstly they delivered my bags in Val d'isere to the wrong address, without informing me, so I flew back to London under the impression my bags were still with Wizz. Only because I had my phone number written on my luggage did I find out where it was (still in Val d'isere). It's now been 2 months since I flew with Wizz and still no sign of either of my bags. I wouldn't wish this situation on my worst enemy as this has been hell trying to get any information/progress on my luggage. Wizz charge £1.45/min on landline calls and £15 fee for calls that could be 'handled online'. For any money you save on flying with Wizz you will pay for it in admin and awful customer service.

They even did not have a plane in site at time of go to gate. Did not bothered to announce the delay or to make sure the airport displays the delay. NO ANNOUNCEMENT in the airport. The data should have come from this company. Because of the 2 hours delay without any responsibility, they decided it is cheaper to allocate the aircraft after check in is closed. I am pretty sure the hygiene on board is missing in action. And we had a fly proudly flying around with us all the way home. Useless delays, total disrespect of the passengers, constant overbooking/oversold tickets, no time for actually hygiene in the aircraft. An air pirate of the same type as Ryan Air. It is no wonder they are the sole remaining low costs around with multiple routes. It is not complicated to be profitable if you abuse your clients with regulations on your side. Everybody dreams of selling something they don't actually have. It is sad when this is a trip to your holiday. Isn't it? Why do regulations help them? How is it possible to not announce the flight delay until the passengers passed the gate? Because of regulations. So let's change them for better. Do not protect such companies.

The second time, I checked in early online and bought a seat beside the window but when I got in the plane the crew said I can seat in any free seat.

I anticipated all of the above seeing as it is beyond budget (not that the price reflects that!).

22770,Wizz Air,1,"""single worst experience""",24th April 2023,True," This is the single worst experience with an airline I have ever had. Everything about this was just insane. Promises of 'budget Friendly' were just the start. Me and my partner flew from Athens to Gatwick, £300 with cabin overhead baggage not included? (We are from Australia where this is standard for all airlines) If the tickets were actually budget I would understand. We arrived at Athens airport to find our flight delayed 2 hours. Ok, it's bad having your flight delayed but I gave them the benefit of the doubt since this happens to a lot of airlines. We looked up the aircraft info to find that there was no previous flight. As we waited at the airport we had 5 or 6 different times given to us by Wizz. Once the gate finally opened we made our way. We sat on the ground since seating was not available. Once we were ok to board we were put onto a bus to go to the plane. Once we arrived the driver opened the doors, told us ""don't exit yet"" and so we were left on the bus (packed in very tightly, there are no seats) for 15-20 minutes as we watched the cabin crew cleaning the plane through the windows. Why drive us out if the aircraft is not ready? And the plane has not had a previous flight AND was delayed 2 hours, the plane should have been prepared already? Once we finally got off the bus we were met by what I would find out to be some of the rudest hosts on a plane I have ever met. Every 5 seconds over the PA ""please do not block the aisles to avoid further delays"" to me seemed a bit rich after our experience so far. Also people are boarding, we aren't going to be seated in 3 seconds? When we sat, the aircraft was in a disgustingly awful state. Crumbs are everywhere, rubbish was left in the seat pockets. This aircraft was sitting here at the airport for a long time and the crew had done an abysmal job at preparing for passengers. The flight itself, once we got into the air was ok. Nothing special (they like to push their 'duty free' items on you for purchase, however I found that I could buy most of this stuff at Tesco for half the price). We landed at Gatwick and this is where the true torture began. Passengers stood to collect their luggage. As we were departing, the host grabbed the PA, stared directly into passengers eyes with the most disgusting look I have ever seen from flight crew ""DO NOT BLOCK THE AISLE WHILE WE ALIGHT FROM THE AIRCRAFT"" this was met with passengers fuming, how are we meant to get our luggage down then? He repeated it as I walked towards the front door of the aircraft ""DO NOT BLOCK THE AISLE WHILE WE ALIGHT FROM THE AIRCRAFT"" he proceeded to put down the microphone then step in front of me, put his finger to my face and said ""WAIT"" passengers piled behind me after this man had just told us not to block the aisles. He put his finger down ""ok go"". Me and my partner were livid.

I received the link to process my refund, but I was surprised that the system doesn’t allow you to get the refund until you first claim for a credit. After processing my credit, the system gives you another link to process your 100% refund, but when you get to the point to enter your credit card information, the system don’t allow you to go forward. No question could be answered. I’ve been trying to get in contact with someone from customer services, but no luck. You call the number they have for customer service, but no one answer. A lot of emails have been sent, but no response. The next day I received the notification of the cancellation, I went to Rome Airport (Fiumicino) but there is no one who represent the company.

So we had to run to another terminal to pay - at which time there was 5 minutes left before the flight. When we asked how to get to the terminal, it was listed at the other terminal (3) (which was a good distance away) but the Wizz Air employee told us it was terminal 4. There were other customers from all over the world (Irish, Portuguese) who had the same problem. At this stage in the game I insisted they show us where we should go. But of course, we had to go through security - where they (temporarily) lost our passports! Honestly, I was afraid of having a heart attack.

Then we were charged $70 baggage, on top of the $140 we had already paid for baggage.

I decided to pay for selected seats up the front with extra leg room on both flights and got really lucky with having no one in my row for the first flight. The second flight I chose a seat with no middle seat and was really happy with this decision. As it’s a cheap airline a lot of people do not pay for the seat upgrade, it’s really not expensive to purchase the extra leg room and well worth it for the comfort! Plus you will likely not have many people around. The food and drink on board is very expensive, but as I knew this beforehand I purchased food and water at the airport to take on the flight with me. I think I was lucky with the reliability of both my flights taking off on time as this was the one thing I was worried about! The seats are very dirty (front seat pocket) but all airlines are usually quite unhygienic so this was to be expected. The service on board I thought was great, very friendly staff and attentive.

22812,WOW air,1,"""fly a more reliable airline""",6th March 2019,False,"  We had booked the Wowair stopover Detroit to Barcelona via Keflavik and just shy of 2 weeks prior to our vacation (family of 5), we received a text and email from Wowair saying they had cancelled our BCN stopover. Because we had already scheduled time off work and school and hotels, cars, meeting others in Barcelona, we were forced to buy connections on Air France. WOW said they could get us as Paris so we had to purchase 5 round air tickets from CDG to BCN, lost 2 days of our vacation, lost a night in a hotel in BCN, had to pay for a hotel at CDG, spent almost 2 full days dealing with connections, layovers (extra costs for food, car etc) Then several days before our DTW to KEF flight, WOW air changed our airplane and scattered us all over the airplane (kids in middle seats in back etc). We were one of the first to book on the flight (Was empty at time) and had paid to purchase upgraded seats together/seats together. Wow did not honor seat assignments. spent close to 2 days on phone / email / twitter support with Wowair and AirFrance and hotels/car rental scheduling, rescheduling, getting seat assignments, seeking compensation. Wow cites an EU regulation that if cancel 2 weeks before, will offer no compensation; they slipped in just before 2 week window with cancelled flights. The staff was very nice but the company is just horrible. We were out approximately $2000 all in and no compensation or accommodation from company. Very sad because this was a long planned family trip that we had saved for and planned for a long time. The day we were flying, the company was offering ""free flights to people with the last name Valentine"". Very gimmicky and not taking care of their paying customers. Lastly, truly the most uncomfortable flight we have ever been on. It is a discount airline but so this is to be expected (though not at all discount when they screw you and cancel your flight). The economy / no upgrade seats are the most uncomfortable you could imagine, people were very miserable. Many families, could not move around at all. The first three rows were very large, like the people could do a pike/legs straight out. Makes no sense to give the upgraded seats too much room while the other 30 rows really suffered. The flights were packed and a lot of unhappy people. They charge for even water so the by the time you pay for water, food, definitely consider an upgrade, charges for luggage and if you are really unlucky - cancellation fees - you could fly first class with a reputable airline. Iceland is lovely but fly Delta or United or partners or anyone but Wowair. I read many many complaints on the internet etc. that they did this same behavior to many many other people.

They offered to fy us out of Boston but offered no compensation and we still paid the same price as we would’ve if we left from LA. Their costumer service is horrible! They block emergency exits with their food cart and even sat a 10 year old in the exit row. Unbelievable!

22814,WOW air,8,"""cheap price and direct flight""",1st March 2019,True,"  I flew with a friend to Iceland from Toronto for a 4 day trip. We were attracted to wow air because of the cheap price and direct flight to Keflavík international airport near Reykjavík. It is important to note for travellers that you do have to pay for a carry on bag and pay for a checked bag, so my friend and I packed our checked luggage together and split the cost, however, make sure to pay attention to the weight. The website advertises that it needs to be 20kg and as long as we were under 21kg the attendant was fine with our bag. On the flight itself, there is a decent amount of space for a backpack under the seat in front and for the price you’re paying, it’s great. I was blown away by the customer service on the flight there. I am a very nauseous flyer typically, I get motion sickness on any moving vessel. I took a different type of gravol than normal and needless to say ended up vomiting 4 times on the 5.5 hour flight. After the 2nd time I vomited, they offered to move me up to premium class but I declined. After the 3rd time they offered again to move me where I had more space to be comfortable and where there would be less intense turbulence. They were so attentive and kept checking up on me to make sure I was okay.

Leaving from Pittsburgh, the flights were only 299 USD with cancellation protection. It is a month before we are scheduled to leave and WOW air cancels both our leaving and returning flights. Most airlines that I fly with offer you a lateral alternative so that some indemnity is given to the customer. Not in this case. WOW air only presents customers with two offers: to cancel for a full refund or to cancel and receive a gift certificate worth the cost of your trip and an additional 25%. Although this seems like a nice offer, the tickets to fly out of Boston or New York (as they have cancelled all of the flights from Pittsburgh) are twice the price of what we originally paid. I think WOW air is betting on the fact that customers will have made reservations and would be hesitant to cancel. What a racket. My best advice would be to never book with this company as you will waste time and money in the end. I made some non-refundable accommodations that will now go to waste but in my mind its better than playing into WOW air's deceitful marketing strategy.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Pittsburgh to Reykjavík,February 2019,1.0,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,no

I purchased through a third party vendor and apparently it is only for the economy fare, so no luggage or seats. So I have been watching to see if I need to purchase them early. I haven't been able to see the seats since November, so in February I emailed customer service to ask why. They told me because my flight was cancelled. I guess they do not fly out of Los Angeles anymore, much to my surprise because my flight is in 3 weeks. No one ever emailed me or called me to notify me, I would have been at the airport and had a big surprise. Now I am trying to get a refund and they are disputing the amount I paid, they do not want to pay me approx $300, even though I have sent over screen shots of my credit card showing I paid a total of $1300.

22820,WOW air,1,"""never fly with WOW again""",21st February 2019,True,"  Paris to Detroit via Keflavik. This was my first time flying with wow. I flew with them initially because it was really cheap. It ended up not being any cheaper then any other airline in the end. I knew I had to pay for my bags but I didn’t look into how much. I didn’t pay for my bags before because I had an oversized bag and there was no option to pay for that. My 45L pack that I always bring as a carry on for every other airline was not allowed to be a carry on for wow. So I had to pay for 2 bags which costs me $150 USD each way. I was shocked by this. After paying this hefty fee, on my way home my bag got lost. The system was down so the lady said she would email me what my bag reference number would be. She did not. I had to email her only for her to tell me that they had no idea where my bag was. I told them I was going on a trip to Hawaii and they said that they would ship my bag there to me. I said absolutely not as my bag was a massive ski bag with miscellaneous other gear in it that I did not want to lug around in Hawaii. One thing that was in my bag that I needed was my hiking shoes. I had to buy a new pair for $200. While I was in Hawaii I kept asking for updates on my bag and they just stopped answering my emails. I come to find out that they actually shipped my bag to my house and never told me. My bag with over $2000 of gear was sitting on my front porch in the rain, while I was in Hawaii. I was lucky it was not stolen. I will never fly with WOW again.

22821,WOW air,1,"""I give them a poor rating""",16th February 2019,True,"  We were scheduled to fly from Newark to Reykjavík and then from there to Dublin on WOW Air. As many know this company is low budget and a cheap way to get to Iceland and some major cities in Europe. We paid for upgrades seats so we weren’t cramped and also got the fare that included a carry on and a checked bag. While we were in the front of the plane if you don’t buy priority boarding passes it’s basically a free for all to board. At that point we sat on the plane and waited for two hours until they tried to figure out what was wrong with a “sensor” on the plane. They deplaned us after two hours. We sat in the terminal for another hour. After that. We waited and it was becoming clearer that we would not make our connecting flight to Dublin. No one on the ground knew the results and what would happen when we got to Iceland and with limited flights out of that airport the choice was do we wait out WOW or get on another flight in Newark on another airline at our cost. So ultimately WOW canceled our flight. As I was on the phone waiting on the phone I got a flight on Aer Lingus direct to Dublin and since WOW canceled our first flight they gave me the option. To cancel the whole round trip flight for my whole family. Which I did. They also said that they would credit me the money for our hotel to stay in Newark for a flight the next day. So I have to submit that claim later today. While I am paying more for my flight to Dublin now I’m not out the money to WOW as I have an e-mail confirmation of the flight cancellation and refund amount. So if they try to not refund me I can dispute the charges to my card. Some other notes the customer service people on the 800 number knew the flight was canceled before the people at the checkin desk. They also sorted me on to another plane 2 days later which would have really screwed me up for the trip. The day delay was not a super big deal. Also with limited options to Iceland I’d be careful booking tours in Iceland before you arrive. Folks were flying to Iceland and had these expensive tours booked and they were going to be out tons of money. While ultimately WOW made it right and I’ll get my money back I would not recommend them at all. However, with limited choices to Iceland if you must fly them to get there wait or give yourself an extra 24 hours before booking those expensive tours that might not refund you the money if you don’t get there. If you are just stopping over and connecting in Iceland to another destination with WOW Air pay more and get on one of the larger carriers. They have larger fleets to add flights and put you on other planes. The person at the WOW desk also was very clear that they have no relationships with other airlines. They won’t be able to get you on another flight out of your airport unless it’s a WOW flight. Unlike say Aer Lingus who has a relationship with Air Canada, etc. For all this I give them a poor rating.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Dublin via Rekyavik,February 2019,1.0,1.0,,1.0,,,2.0,no

Back home, we filed a request and Wow aiR granted us a compensation (which they are bound to do by law!!) and said that processing the payment would take between 10-12 weeks.

I don’t mind no meal on a flight, not really a fan of airplane food anyway. I thought the connection seemed tight but it was what WOW advertised. So the flight out of Chicago was delayed. No reason was shared, no real info, it was just delayed by about 2 hours but the flight crew announced over the speaker on the plane. “They will hold your connections for you and we will make up time in the air”. Well that was a lie, don’t announce things that aren’t true. So once we got inside the airport multiple connecting flights were missed so there was a line 30-40 people long with 1 only, 1 WOW employee giving directions. Really WOW, you couldn’t do anything to assist all the passengers at that point? So after waiting 20-30 minutes in the line the lady tells me follow the arrivals signs and an agent will be waiting to direct you. Was there an agent, absolutely not. But I did find about 7 other passengers who were on the same connecting flight all wondering around lost wondering what was going on. We were able to piece together some info a few of us received different emails from WOW giving different info. By sharing with each other we realized we could book an airport hotel and they rebooked us on flights the next day. But not one of us had complete info and only by talking to each other could we piece this together. Finally after over an hour someone who worked at the airport, not WOW, got someone from WOW to speak to us and get a bus to take us to the hotel. We were told be ready for a bus to arrive by 3.30am in the morning to take us to the airport. Was there a bus nope, no bus. There were way more WOW stranded passengers at the hotel who arrived after us. The hotel called their shuttle service to come at 4am and take a huge bus full of all the passengers WOW stranded in Iceland and then again at the hotel. Huge thanks to Airport B&B.

Luckily the person sitting next to me offered to give me water. On the way home there was only a 20 minute delay however baggage claim took over an hour to get which made us miss our next flight. We were not able to check in our luggage for our next flight as we had 30 minutes left and the flight was already boarding passengers. Because of this we had to book a new flight to get back home.

The seats were ok, not smaller than usual now-a-days and also not uncomfortable. I was well aware that everything was paid for, so I brought food and water onboard, which is what I usually do anyway. I had a checked in suitcase, a carry-on backpack and a plastic bag for my snacks, I had no problem whatsoever with these. The flight to Paris was delayed by about half an hour, which they claimed was because we were to wait for passengers from another delayed flight. I can’t complain, I would have liked them to do this for me as well, if I were in their position. Overall, I think the airline is good. It is very cheap, and you get what you paid for.

It all start in Berlin when my flight to Keflavik was delayed by almost an hour, from 12.25 pm original time to 13.45. That meant that my connecting flight was almost impossible to reach. Before boarding, I got another email stating that my SFO flight was also delayed but only by 40 min (WW161 KEF-SFO 26OCT18 original time was 15.10 delayed to 15.50) Once landed in Keflavik it was imposible to reach my flight, even when my boarding to SFO was announced I was denied to cut line in customs by WOW personal. They stated that I had time. So when I lost my flight, I went to the WOW counter and was given the solution of flying to Cincinnati even when there was a flight from another airline to SFO that same day. The flight to Cincinnati was at 21.00 the same day. Also, they didn't give me a connection from Cincinnati to SFO, they stated that they where working on it and that we where going to get help by a WOW representative once we got to Cincinnati (other people where in the same position). This never happened, no WOW representative was there once we got of the plane, simply because WOW cease to exist in Cincinnati a few days ago. So, I never got a confirmation of a suppose connecting flight to SFO (some people did and others like me didn't. Their connection was from Cincinnati to Newark to SFO adding a 10 hour plus journey also there was a DELTA flight directly to SFO but was denied by WOW costumer service - I talked to WOW support to try to fix the situation but it was helpless, they even gave me a wrong booking number for my supposed connection, it was named to another person. Luckily I was helped by the United counter, an after an hour of back and forth, they could figure out what WOW messed up. Of course that I had lost my chance to get into the 6 am flight to Newark, so I had to wait for the Cincinnati- Denver 9.25 am flight, and then catch the Denver- SFO at 11.55 am local time (both of this flights where on United) And also, another layer to this nightmare, is that my bags are still lost.

During our 23-day individually planned US tour, my baggage did not arrive in Los Angeles or could only be delivered to Los Angeles seven days later. This was, according to the airline Wow-Air in Boston. In this baggage were all my clothes and all the cosmetics of both of us. This led to significant disabilities and rescheduling of the individually planned round trip. WOW-Air offered me instead of the required € 763 (expenses for clothes, cosmetics, medicine, contact lenses, increased fuel costs and parking fees) only a lump sum of $25 per day. This is €137 and is just a fraction of the cost we had in addition. In doing so, you plead that I can continue to use the newly purchased clothes and cosmetics at home. This is logically not possible, becaus many cosmetics in the end was duplicated and could not be taken home for space and weight reasons. In addition, all these purchases would not have been necessary if my suitcase had arrived properly. In USA you have to visit an eye specialist for new lenses. Even the eye specialist costs in the amount of 100€ were not considered. In addition, 13 calls were required to receive the case after a week in Los Angeles. I submitted a screenshot of it. But this cost assumption is denied. Just the detour from Death Valley to Los Angeles Airport cost us a whole day and is ignored by WOW-Air. WOW-Air employees are consciously playing against each other and sticking to their delay strategy. I have already sent a lot of information and evidence twice, but they continue to be ignored.

While for sure it is a no frills low cost airline, I have to say it is fairly good value for money. I flew from DTW to CPH via KEF, I found the ground staff, cabin crew and all other contact personnel very efficient, approachable and polite. Both aircraft I flew with were modern A-321s. While the seats were not the most comfortable, and in the basic seat the legroom was fairly tight they did recline a little and there were power sockets/USD points at each seat. Selection of drinks and snacks which were available for purchase was also quite good.

22882,WOW air,1,"""upset with our experience""",13th September 2018,True,"  Chicago to Paris via Reykjavík. My husband and I flew this airline for our honeymoon to Paris. To say we were unimpressed would be an understatement. First off, I was unable to add any baggage to my reservation to fly out of Chicago to Paris, because of this we were charged almost $300 at the airport because we were not even allowed a carry on bag. We travel often and this is not the case with any other airline we have used. If we would have known this we would have packed accordingly. There is not much you can do about this besides pay the money when you are at the airport. Then we find out there is not free in flight entertainment, like the other airlines we have flown overseas. Also, the seats were so crammed together my husbands knees were hitting the seat in front of us the whole time. He could not even put his tray down if he wanted to because of this. Why didn't we pay for extra leg room you ask? Well because we have not had this problem on any other flight we have flown. Then on the way back from Paris I was able to add luggage to our reservation but again, like most airlines, we expected the weight limit to be 23kg per bag. No. It was only 20kg so we had to pull things out of our suitcase to get the weight down. Additionally,the lady checking us in was very rude and was talking about us in French with a very unpleasant look on her face. I am not fluent in French but body language says more than words. The check in attendant also first said that it would cost 10$ per kg over 20 and then after we took some things out she said it was 15$ because we needed to go to Chicago. Well of coarse we needed our bags to go all the way home. I also would  point out that whether our bags were under the plane or in the cabin, there is still the same amount of weight on the plane. Making us open all our luggage to save money in the airport is ridiculous. We were already frustrated and her changing information and being very rude and unprofessional did not help matters. We ended up paying $400 to get our luggage back on top of the $300 that we payed on the way there. This is the price of an extra airline ticket. This being said, we could have flown with ANY other airline and not have dealt with all the inconveniences. We are very upset with our flight experience on this trip. We are frequent travelers and so are many members of our family and because of this experience we are unable to say any kind words about your airline.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Paris via Reykjavík,September 2018,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,no
22883,WOW air,1,"""had to pay or we could not fly""",11th September 2018,True,"  Amsterdam to Detroit via Keflavik. This is not a complaint about the lack of free meals or in-flight entertainment. I know how so-called low cost airlines operate and have never had a problem with any of them until my partner and I tried to fly WOW for the first (and last) time. This is a complaint about the treatment we received and the fees we were charged at the gate of our flight WW447 AMS-KEF, on the date of September 3 at AMS (Schiphol) airport. We booked our WOW air flights months in advance of our flight measured our bags, which fit perfectly within the very restrictive WOW measurements. We have photographs to prove that the bags fit into the bags measurement frame placed at WOW gates. Prior to our flight we checked in online and received boarding passes into email, that was not a problem. However, at the gate of our flight from AMS to KEF we were stopped impolitely by an individual from WOW ground personnel, who started insisting that our bags were carry-ons just because they had 2 wheels, and that we had to pay in order to get them on the plane. She would not even look at my original ticket, where the definition of included luggage only showed dimensions and had in no way specified that included luggage could not have wheels. She never measured the bags, nor weighed them, nothing, just insisted that ""wheels"" cannot be placed under seats due to ""safety."" This individual further refused to provide her name and also prohibited me from taking a photo of her ID for evidence, repeating multiple times that it is not allowed. Every question I tried to ask she dismissed with It is not allowed, to the point that I felt I was talking to a robot. I tried to show her the original ticket on my phone, but she refused to have any human communication or reasoning with me, and kept repeating it is not allowed. When I asked to see a supervisor, she replied, it is not allowed to have a supervisor, after which she moved us to the side and said we were not getting on the flight at all. We had to wait until the entire plane was boarded, when she sent a colleague of hers, who likewise insisted that our small bags were trolleys and were not allowed on the flight for free due to safety. I tried to explain that my original ticket showed no such prohibition whatsoever, but she insisted we had to pay or we could not fly. We absolutely felt blackmailed, humiliated and ended up profoundly disturbed They charged us 160 Euro for our two bags, as we were taking a connect flight to Detroit later that afternoon from Reykjavik, and only then were we allowed to board the flight. Once we paid, however, we were told that we could place our bags wherever we chose, and when I said that the entire affair was not about safety but about paying, they had no response, because this is what it was all about – extorting money from travelers.  If the company wants to prohibit the use of wheeled luggage, it must define the included luggage as such excluding wheels, otherwise am free to interpret the shape or pattern of the luggage freely, as long as it complies with the measurements, which it did.

At least 30 mins late, but my last plane was 2 hours late. The flights are quite stable in being late, so usually being late for the same time. Eat just before flight and buy a bottle of water just before flight. Usually you can do this in airport just before flight, but if late-evening flight (after 22:00), then it make sense to eat before entering airport. 3. Come to Wow air registration anyway (even if you printed boarding passes in advance), so they would print new boarding passes for you. This can prevent some issues. Do not rely on anything to be on-time. For example, I bought 12:30 Gold Ring tour on plane (being sure that flight arrives at 11:00 and then enough time to be at 12:30 to BSI-terminal for taking this tour), but actually plane arrived at 11:12AM and then bus arrived at 12:34, so I was 4 mins late for the tour (and I've seen the tour bus going away trying wave my hands to driver, but it didn't help). As result, lost the 60USD ticket for tour and didn't see Gold Ring that I wanted during flight connections. Better to take rent-car after the flight (because even if flight 2 hours late, you could still take rent car, but this doesn't apply to buses or even could be worse if next-connection-other-companies-flight). This is not about Wow air, but just about Keflavik airport flight-connections during night. During my way back, I had a night in airport. I didn't reserve any hotel. I had a boarding pass in advance and did some walking in Reykjavik during day-time (latest Flybus from BSI-terminal to airport at 20:00), so first I did some walking around outside airport during the evening and then entered at 23:30 the boarding zone without any problems. Then slept about from 00:15 to 4:30. The border (for zone D) closed during night hours, but still if having boarding pass, then can sleep somewhere in zone C just before border. There are no special places to sleep, but if you can sleep both sitting, then it is Ok. The good news that Wow air not so strict on baggage size. The limit is 42x32x25cm for free of charge baggage item, but during my flight back I used school bag with exactly these sizes (and with much inside it could be even 43x33x30cm), and this still was Ok.

22897,WOW air,1,"""a huge risk flying this airline""",18th August 2018,True,"  Los Angeles to Reykjavik. The only reason I considered this airline is because it was the only direct flight and they had ""big seats,"" that we could upgrade to so I thought why not. We paid a lot extra to get the biggest seats, plus bags, meals etc. Well, the night before the flight, we check in and they have put us in standard seats with no extra legroom. They have four types of seats and they put us in the very smallest despite us paying several hundred dollars more per ticket for bigger seats. So, I call the customer service line and they just tell me that I will have to file a claim when I get back! So, my husband calls and they move our seats to what they say are bigger seats. Guess what? They were standard seats on the seat map. So, at that gate they start selling our seats that we already paid for as upgrades! So, my husband goes up and tries to find out why they are selling seats we already paid for and they just offer him some other seats that are supposedly XL but they are in the back of the plane. He says, we don't want seats that don't recline. They say they do recline. So, he agrees and they try to charge him again for an upgrade! Guess what? They are regular standard seats and they don't recline and for extra good measure the plug between the seats doesn't work on either row of seats that they put us in. This was on an overnight flight with my 8-year-old daughter. So, it comes to our return flight - same scenario. They put us in regular standard seats. We called the night before and my husband paid for another upgrade even though we already purchased their highest tier because he doesn't want to argue with them, we just wanted better seats. So, they move our seats, but when we get to the airport, they put us back in the regular standard seats! So, we spent the entire 3 hours at the airport trying to get better seats by talking to 3 different service desks, to no avail. We tell the crew when we get on the plane in case they have any extra decent seats and they offer us one free water. Plugs don't work on this flight either. Every single person we dealt with told us our seats were XL until I showed them the seat map and they will charge you for upgrades in seats that aren't upgrades at all. Everyone just said you'll have to file a claim. Guess what. When I filed a claim when we got back, they declined it and said that we had to contact customer service. Customer Service claimed that they don't deal with refunds. His message told me that I would have to go through an airline rights group. So, they basically tried to steal our money and make it as difficult as possible to get some of our money back. We never got our meals that we paid for or our seats. You are taking a huge risk flying this airline because even if they cancel your flight, you might not get your money back based on their customer service practices of denying legitimate claims.

22899,WOW air,1,"""bumped down two classes""",16th August 2018,True,"  Saint Louis to Reykjavik. Being the first to book WOW Premium on our travel dates, we did not expect three family members to be bumped down two classes of service – from Premium to Basic – and the other two members to be bumped from Premium to Plus. But, that’s what happened two days before departure. How do I know we booked first? Because the seat schematic in premium class was completely empty when we bought tickets 8 months before departure and selected our seats. Plane change was given as the reason, but the real reason was that WOW reconfigured their seats and classes of service, and didn’t notify anyone – at least not us. So instead of re-assigning seats according to booking dates or giving you the option of selecting new seats based on an early-booking priority, we were evidently randomly selected to downgrade even though we would have re-booked different dates had we been given more than 48-hours’ notice. The same thing happened on the way home. We were again bumped to lower service levels. On the way to Iceland, we at least received a few of the Premium perks, including a “meal” that consisted of a 10-inch baguette with two deli-thin slices of ham. But, this time, we were asked to show our receipts to the flight attendants in order to receive the meal and two drinks – one hot and one cold. Yes, that’s right, one hot and one cold. And we were informed that if we wanted two cold drinks we would have to pay for one, even if we were to forego the hot drink. Our luggage arrived with us on the flight to Iceland. It also made it home, which we were happy to discover after a suspenseful, 40-minute wait at St. Louis’ baggage claim. Others weren’t so lucky. At least a half-dozen passengers mentioned that their luggage had been lost. Some on a non-stop flight; others on a connection through Reykjavik to and from Europe. One individual was on his way home after two weeks in Europe; he still hadn’t received his suitcase. Another person mentioned that her luggage never made it onboard the non-stop flight to Iceland. Then, when it did arrive, WOW refused to deliver the bags. They kept them at the airport until her week-long tour returned for the trip back to the States. Fly WOW if cost-savings are paramount and you’re willing to chance the service for the savings. Seats are really small, unless you upgrade.

When we arrived in the Netherlands on a Sunday one of the bags did not arrive. This bag contained everything for two people in our party. Our bag finally arrived shortly before midnight on Tuesday and we flew home on Saturday. So we were without our belongings for almost half of our visit. While WOW air reimbursed us $133.48 for purchases they refused to reimburse us for the $70.00 we paid to check in the ""misplaced"" bag.

The neighboring companies attempted to call them to come back for me but there was no answer to their paging. I then called the customer service line. I was treated with disrespect. The customer service can do nothing at all to help you and informed me I was late to my fight and had missed it and my money was just gone. I requested a spot on the next available flight and even offered to pay full price if they could still honor my charges for my bag and my meals. They said the only thing that they were able to do was refund me $40 in taxes. They openly admitted the flight had open seats but they were “greyed out” and couldn’t be filled.

22904,WOW air,1,"""a lack of care from WOW""",27th July 2018,True,"  Cincinnati to Edinburgh via Keflavik.Our baggage was missing when we arrived to Keflavik. We had plans to take a short walk to the bus stop, this was impossible due to the cold weather and our lack of appropriate clothes.  We were not asked where our address will be and a multitude of appropriate questions that could have possibly helped with the recovery of our luggage.  We were told to check in with the luggage office before our 6:50am flight.The office does not open until 8:30am, we left our hotel early and did not have time for breakfast. ( Our flight was moved to an earlier time.. We were not informed about this at all, on any type of communication platform. This caused us to be denied check in.  The lady at check-in was abrupt and unwilling to check my pregnant wife in while I was at the (CLOSED) luggage office. As I returned from the luggage office to the check-in desk we were told check in for our flight was closed so I asked to speak with a supervisor who then rectified the situation by checking us in.  Me and my wife (34 weeks pregnant) were given the option to hurry up to terminal D (7 min jog). No care, help or advice was offered. It was clearly explained that we were not informed of the flight time change and that my wife is pregnant. We actually asked ourselves to get in-front of people at the security check and when we arrived at gate.  We were a total of 13 days without luggage. This is our first child and we were getting married on July 15th. Our wedding clothes and child birthing equipment were in the suitcases. WOW air have stated that we should have packed all essential clothing in our carry-on. We were told to go to Edinburgh airport to collect our bags, at our expense. One bag was still missing when we went to the airport and upon arrival the second bag was damaged. Customer service was really bad throughout the whole process. Calls to wow air were not helpful, some were put on hold, in the worst case we were on hold for 25 minutes and the deliberately disconnected when I asked to speak with a supervisor. Emails did not answer very simple questions. On our flight was a couple from Cincinnati who were traveling to Scotland for their honeymoon, this was the second time WOW air tried to get them to Keflavik. As we were not informed of the flight change and the couple were not on the Edinburgh flight on the 21st of June, it stands to reason they missed their flight due to a lack of care from WOW.",,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Cincinnati to Edinburgh via Keflavik,June 2018,2.0,1.0,,1.0,,,2.0,no

22907,Xiamen Airlines,2,"""has been, by far, the worst airline""",20th September 2021,True,"  This has been, by far, the worst airline that I have ever had the misfortune to encounter. I showed up at Xiamen Airport (Xiamen Airlines flagship hub) 5 hours in advance of my flight for two reasons. First, I knew that my bags would be overweight (I was moving back home to the states), and I wanted to see by how much. I had some items I could discard to make the baggage lighter, but I wanted to see how much over I was. Second, since COVID still had regulations, I wanted to be sure that I had enough time to get through the process on time. Xiamen Airlines, unfortunately, did not make any of this process possible. When I arrived at the airport, I was informed that I would not be able to set foot into the international wing until two hours before the flight took off. This forced me to wait until they opened the wing. Once the wing was open, the sold-out flight loaded up the kiosks. The line was moving unbelievably slow, but I knew that the attendants were able to see me waiting and that I probably will need extra help. This entire process of getting through the line nearly took an hour and a half.  Once I got to the front of the line, the first thing that they informed me of was that there were only middle seats left. I said to them that they saw me waiting in line, and I am considerably taller than most of the people on the flight. Rather than give any explanation, the only thing they said was, “we know”. Checking my watch, I knew that there was no time to belabor the point any longer. I had three bags, and I knew that they would have weight problems. In addition, I would need to pay extra for the third bag. I was ready to pay for the extra bag, but what happened next was madness. I sent them countless emails explain my grievances with the airline, and it took them literal days(and one time a week) to respond to me. The fact that this could not be resolved in a matter of minutes was frustrating enough, but then for them to not care about my original complaint and say that it was my fault is what drove me to write this complaint today.

XiaMen Airline is aware of this new policy. However, they continue advertising and selling the connecting flight tickets through the Netherlands! I bought the ticket from London to China via an overnight transfer in Amsterdam. However, when I started to go through the details soon after I bought the ticket, I was shocked to find out that this is an impossible flight route due to the reason above. I contacted XiaMen Airline immediately. I received a reply call informing me that my request for refunding my flight ticket is rejected. The reason given was that XiaMen Airline made a policy, they only refund the flight tickets which were bought before 31st October 2020, and the flight will take off after 31st October 2020. My flight ticket was bought yesterday, 9th December 2020. Therefore, I fell out of the category of refunding. I pointed out that if they knew this is the policy, why they were still selling the tickets from London to China, which needs to transfer at Amsterdam. I was told that it was because some passengers will take the flights from Amsterdam. This was not answering my question. However, the customer service only gave me standard answers in a circle.

Good amount of pitch. Movie selections were limited but adequate. Food was terrible for our taste. The kids meal for my 11 year old was also mostly inedible. Service was great however. Flight attendants had great attitude and seemed to be working nonstop. 737 between Xiamen and Taipei was old and dirty. Don't understand why they would also offer a meal for such a short flight. I hate wasting food but couldn't eat that one either. Transit at Qingdao was confusing. We were given the wrong arrival cards twice so had to rewrite them 3 times. Transit hotel in Xiamen was free for our 8 hour layover. Hotel was not in good shape. I would rate it 2.5 star. On our return trip, we took the hotel option again and asked if we could pay extra for a better hotel. He said no and insisted to give us 3 rooms for the 5 of us. Then he entered in one of the names wrong on the reservation. I now have some personal information of some guy named Dustin. The hotel this time is a different. Not as bad, maybe a 3.5 star. But both hotels didn't have non-smoking rooms. I overheard another guest requesting a non-smoking room and was rudely told to come back down and ask for another room she didn't like the room.

22933,Xiamen Airlines,2,"""they are a 3rd rate airline""",4th December 2018,False,"  Seattle to Manila via Xiamen. My wife and I planned a trip to the Philippines from Seattle and decided upon Xiamen Airlines Business Class. The routing was Seattle, Shenzen, Xiamen and Manila. We traveled late October 2018. The seating configuration in the Boeing 787, Business Class was 2-2-2. The seats were lay flat for sleeping, but unfortunately were leatherette covered which meant one would slide forward when seated upright due to the slippery covering. Lunch was served and I chose duck. This was the consistency of rubber and virtually inedible. The 12.5 hour flight was uneventful, however during this time the cabin staff barely checked on us. When they did, there was a distinct language problem. We couldn't understand them and they couldn't understand us! One would think when one is on a international flight a common understandable language should be used. When we arrived at Shenzen we had a layover of 2 hours during which time we had to clear Chinese Customs and Immigration. After this we had to wait in a departure lounge without being told anything about our next flight leg. There were about 12 onward passengers waiting for the next leg. Eventually we were told our boarding gate and ETD. The flight to Xiamen was around 1 hour. After arrival we had to pick up our luggage and we went to the Xiamen Airlines counter to get a hotel voucher as we had 20 hour layover. Xiamen Airlines to not have a hotel bus or any means to transport us to the hotel. We had to change money to get a taxi. This was an effort in its own right. We did leave some of our baggage at the left luggage office at the airport, which helped. The next day we caught a taxi back to the airport. We go through security on entry to the airport before checking in for our flight to Manila. I should mention that boarding to Manila like the short leg for Shenzen was chaos. No boarding by class or seating, just go for it! Service on board was almost like a domestic flight, again a language problem. We arrive in Manila after almost 36 hours after leaving Seattle. It was nice to experience the friendliness of Philippine Customs and Immigration. The return from Manila to Seattle every bit as bad as when we arrived late (11:30pm) in Xiamen we had to clear customs and immigration and by the time that happened it was around 2am banks were closed and we had now money for a taxi to the hotel we finally change $20 with a Xiamen Airline staff member and got to the hotel around 2:30 am. We were again routed via Shenzen and had to go through immigration and carry ALL bags through security. The flight back was slightly better, but there was still the language barrier. All in all the Xiamen Airlines experience was poor. The airline should make sure the cabin staff have sufficient English to carry out a basic conversation. The airline should upgrade all staff to a level of what is expected from a good international airline.

22934,Xiamen Airlines,8,"""at a very cheap price""",3rd December 2018,True,"  Singapore to Vancouver via Xiamen. Note that my rating here is for XMN-YVR, not considering SIN-XMN, and not taking into account the visa issues at XMN. If you are not a holder of one of the 53 countries' passports that qualify for visa exemption by the Chinese government, then you need to apply for a visa before flying. XMN does not offer visa services at the airport. The main reason for the need of a visa is, XMN does not have a usual transit arrangement, which usually doesn't require you to go through immigration. At XMN, in order to transit, you have to go through immigration, which means you are entering China and then leaving China officially, just to transit between flights. This is why people transiting with passports that do not qualify for visa exemption have to apply for visa. If you are unsure, please make sure you email your local Xiamen Air representatives to check. Regarding SIN-XMN, it was below average. It was an older aircraft, without individual IFE system. The stewardesses were willing to help and respond to demands, but they were typically brisk and curt with their responses. Food was okay, not remarkable. XMN-YVR was excellent. The economy seat was comfortable, and leg room was good. Food was excellent and more than sufficient. In fact, the stewardesses made rounds between meals to ask if people wanted snacks, like bread rolls, sandwiches, or peanuts. The stewardesses were very friendly and approachable, very willing to help the passengers. It is unfortunate that their command of the English language is below average, but if you speak Mandarin, then you are fine. All in, it was an excellent flight at a very cheap price. I think, if you are travelling on Xiamen Air's Boeing 787, then there is a good chance that your flight will be a very good one. But if you are travelling on Xiamen Air's older aircraft, then you may not get to experience the better side of the airline. Finally, there is no online check-in services for international flights for Xiamen Air. You can choose your seats only if you spend some money. Otherwise, you have to request for your seat at the counter at the airport. So, if you want to choose your seats, either pay for it, or go to the airport and check in early (I went 2.5hr before flight) to get the seats that you want.",Boeing 737-800 / 787-8 ,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Vancouver via Xiamen,November 2018,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,yes

Xiamen Airlines does a twice weekly direct flight from Hong Kong. They deploy a small 737 aircraft. Similar to Malaysia airlines when using this small aircraft, 4 cabin crew work tirelessly to keep the journey smooth and comfortable. With one aisle and 3x3 seating, the pitch is quite comfortable. A simple hot meal (in the style of a bento box) is served, and is sufficient for a short 90 minutes journey. 2 rounds of drinks is a nice touch. Seat has no power outlet or personal, we were provided visual entertainment in the form of overhead TV, with mainly Chinese program. Luckily, since January, mobile phones in flight mode are now allowed to be used on board. So you can still listen to your favourite music, or watch your own videos etc., on your phone or tablets.

Not once, but twice. Booked a trip from Sydney to Fuzhou via Kunming. I arrived at Sydney airport only to find out that my Fuzhou - Kunming has been changed (amusingly and amazingly) to earlier than my flight from Sydney. Talked to service desk, couldn't help, gave me a number to call. Called all the numbers he gave, none worked. Went on Google and called the number online. They speak Chinese in their automated voicing system. I had to get the guy from the service desk to go through it for me. Eventually answered but staff was so slow and gentle (my flight was in 2h). He tried to book my connecting flight 2 days later. I was crying so much, begging him that we have schedules booked and everyone will leave me behind. I don't speak Chinese and I don't know anyone. Finally managed to find me a flight the next morning. Put me on hold. Came back half an hour later saying their system crashed. Told me he couldn't help anymore, and that I have to hang up and call back and go through the line again. It was 1h before my flight and I still couldn't get my flight confirmed. I was crying so much that the guy at the service desk told me to charge some international calling on my phone and then he helped me call the airline in China. They got it sorted out in like 15min. I went through everything, got to the gate and my flight was annouced delay. For the return flight I went to the airport at 4am for my flight back at 7am. The girl at check in counter gave me 5 words of horror : ""We can't find your flight"" Turned out flight was cancelled (ah yes again) and have to take the one 5 hours later. Fine. Waited a few hours, went to check in again. This time there were 5 other words of horror: ""Your passport number is incorrect."" Uhm... Sorry? Double checked my booking. My passport was entered correctly. So imagine being by yourself, running around China airport trying to get this sorted when they don't speak English. No, seriously, save yourself the trouble and never fly with this airline. No matter how good their in-flight service is, it can't compensate all the time and emotions I have wasted on this.

Be advised, you can’t get out of the airport unless you have Chinese visa. I have never heard that you need to get a transit visa for couple of hours layover. I was told to cancel my round trip with Xiamen airlines and get a refund. After 6-7 hrs of phone calls with the airline, I was issued 15% refund of the total cost. The agent explained that somehow my outbound ticket was activated (I flew with a different airline but they still activated my ticket!) and the “activated” ticket was 85% of the cost and I’m only getting 15% refund for the return flight.

Such a deal - R/T LAX to ICN (Seoul Korea) for $450 per person!  If you are not Asian or don't like Asian food - please pack your own food. Found this airline to be just as professional, efficient, and friendly to fly with. Our flight did have to go thru 2 Chinese ports of entry (Qingdao & Xiamen). The flight was very comfortable due to the new airplane (Boeing 787-9). I noticed the increased air pressure (6000 ft elevation) and increased humidity did not dry me out and felt good at the end of 14 hours in flight. The flight staff was very courteous, attentive, and tried their best with English but Google translate came in handy to communicate. Wifi was available but not very good - too many people using it and not enough bandwidth for streaming. Food was good - 2 hot meals and 2 cold snacks in-between kept you full and satisfied. Very Chinese cuisines on all 4 legs of the flight (2 international, 2 domestic). Just remember, the airline is Chinese and therefore will serve Chinese food - don't expect Panda Express type food like the US. The food is primarily pork based with some fish, chicken or beef offering. If you elect vegetarian or muslim or any other special needs food, make sure you request this 24 hours before your flight. I saw some western folks unhappy with seeing unfamiliar Chinese food being served on a Chinese airline - I had to chuckle watching them eat the bread and desert for their meals. The only issue which is not the airline's fault was going thru Chinese immigration. We did not have a Chinese visa which is normally required for landing in China, but 50+ countries can ""transit"" thru China if you can prove your final destination is outside of China. The government issues a temporary transit visa for those that are going thru the country - it's good for 24 hours. At our 2 hr layover for refueling, Qingdao was the worst - they scrutinized and held up the entire non Chinese group of passengers looking for errors & past problems. They pulled 2 passengers out of the group for failing to register with a local Chinese police agency the last time they were in China. Military uniformed people surrounded them making you feel like you are in a communist country.... The airline staff was very good at preparing you for Chinese immigration - having your itinerary with you, boarding pass with correct name spelled, etc. Landing at Xiamen was much easier and nicer immigration folks. We even had time to visit the First class airport lounge using our Amex Plat card. Return trip was good and we even had an overnight layover and the airline provided a hotel for the night at no cost which was nice. We did have to pay the taxi rides both ways so remember to bring some Chinese Yuan (RMB) currency. We got to also go on a tour of the city on a double decker sightseeing bus that took us all around the perimeter of the island.

Another review reminded me of the barely audible English announcements (use headphones to hear it). The seats and legroom seem average. The Boeing 787 for the LAX-XMN segment is a nice, new aircraft. The entertainment system had a small selection of music and movies, which were adequate. Emirates scores better there! The website is hard to use, and changes seemed impossible. But I successfully purchased a ticket. If I purchased again, I would be certain everything is perfect before clicking Submit. I'm hesitant to call ""customer service"" as English is not their main language, and rules over customer satisfaction seem to be the situation. The worst part of the flight was the layover in Xiamen, China. Border control entry is required, followed by departure control. This is slow and time consuming. Re-entering security is very strict. Every passenger is wanded after passing the magnetometers. My baggage scan revealed two small Bic lighters, which were confiscated. Any lithium batteries in checked bags are likely to be removed. The airport is years behind many International airports, and is hard to spend time in. However, long layovers can qualify you for a hotel room (+5 hours), a city tour, or the lounge on the lowest level - with free Wi-Fi. The lounge was quite basic and drab. Hard to call it a ""benefit"". A room in the back had cots. In the airport, I was twice offered working iPhones for cash. With a landing announcement that mentions contacting quarantine if you're ill, including headaches, nausea or diarrhea, and the scrutiny upon entry and exit, I don't advise buying black market iPhones.

Then I confronted a member of cabin crew and he kept saying it was the tower controller who had said the plane would push back in 10 mins and then told us to wait. The lack of transparency, coupled with highly restricted air traffic by military has tarnished this airline's reputation. Never fly on Chinese domestic routes if you had a choice.

They personal entertainment system has a large screen, and the system worked just as I wanted without struggle. A safety card, two magazines and a menu in the pocket; a blanket and a bottle of water on the seat. But the menu missed a translation for breakfast. The food is not bad but can be improved. The crew were trying to act as friendly, but lacked some sincereness, but they did a great job. Their English skill really needs improvement.  As a Chinese airline they followed the CAAC rule, which restricted people to use their laptops and other devices only when the aircraft reached cruising attitude and didn't allow passengers to switch on their phones at all. And they locked the 787 windows to a certain brightness which make them impossible to adjust by passengers. Another problem is that I had a transfer flight at XMN, but I had to pick up my luggage and recheck it again.

Even after scheduled departure time there hadn't been any notifications of a delay. Finally, we were told which gate to go to. We boarded the plane two hours late and had to wait 30 minutes more as the flight attendant said it took that long to load the luggage (even though less than half of the plane was full). When my phone died, I asked an attendant if they could help me to charge it as I didn't know the Chinese name of my hotel in Xiamen. He refused several times until I was very persistent that it would not had died if I had not waited so long for the flight. Landing was smooth but on the way back the same issues existed, all the while announcements on the speaker mentioned how important guests were to Xiamen Airlines. I didn't feel that at all.

Food and drink were very good and IFE was better than I had anticipated - not great (nothing like Emirates, for example), but good, recent international films. The seat lies flat and allowed me (6 ft / 183 cm height) to stretch out comfortably. No wifi and phones have to be switched off, as per Chinese Govt rules. But using a tablet in airline mode is OK. There is an electric socket at the seat and it was enough to power my fairly large laptop. I would fly with them again. The 2nd sector was internal from Xiamen to Changsha.

They provide a hotel if flying all legs of trip on Xiamen Airlines with overnight layover, entertainment and food caters to Chinese tastes. I speak Mandarin, so I rate this flight a 8/10. Screaming deal of a ticket booked in 12/2016. Super nervous after receiving email in January 2017 of seat cancellation for the first leg of my trip (Seattle-Shenzhen). Customer service doesn't speak English. Got a call back in Chinese (my Chinese is ok, but not my first language) and took about 30 minutes plus another 30 minute call back to realize that the seat No I requested was cancelled and not the seat on the flight.  Over next few months, received a few more e-mails stating that flight times had changed, even though they were the same as when we booked them. Still felt insecure about whether or not our trip would really happen.  No online check-in for foreigners. We show up at the airport and have an easy check-in. Heard that Xiamen Air provides a hotel which the airport staff confirmed.  Arrived at Shenzhen to some chaos - they separate the transfers passengers, people are confused as to where to go, but are shepherded by the Xiamen air staff. Waited about 45 minutes with several other foreigners to get my boyfriend's 24-hour transit visa which allows him to leave the airport. Disembarked at Xiamen, shepherded again by the staff to pick up our baggage. Many of the foreign passengers did not know about the hotel that Xiamen air provided us with, since we all arrived around 9pm and had connecting flights in the morning. They expected to sleep on the floor of the airport. Followed signs to the reception desk that makes lodging arrangements. Showed our passports and tickets and provided with a room at the E-Charm Hotel in Xiamen. If you are travelling alone, they will pair you with someone of the same gender. The hotel is about 10 minutes away from the airport and costs about 15 RMB one way. Although the room provided was free, we had to cover our travel expense both ways to and from the hotel. I think this is strange. If you are only going to and from the hotel, the cash machines up on level 2 allow you to take out 100 RMB. Hotel was nice for Chinese standards!

I assumed she meant something about which line so I said this line, the same one as the people you just checked in. She said that I was in the wrong line and that I had to go to the back of the other line (for the other check in booth). I wondered if she thought I had cut in line or something so I told her if she had this type of doubt she should ask the people (who were still standing next to me) if I had been in their line all the time. She refused and told me to go to the back of the other line again and then proceeded to check in the next person in line. I was the last one to check in after waiting an additional 30 - 40 minutes. By this time, it was so close to boarding that I had to run to security and then run to the boarding gate as the plane was already boarding. I had to skip going to duty free to pick up things for my friends in China as I had promised. Even though I had to use the washroom, there was no time for that. No time to grab a snack or drink. It was the most embarrassing, stressful situations I have experienced in a very long time. Actually I can't remember ever being treated like that before. The airlines bounced my complaint back and forth between the Vancouver and Xiamen offices and finally put the blame on me, saying that if I had told her which line I was in this wouldn't have happened.

All flights were on new Boeing 787's. The flights were extremely full, probably due to the fact it was just under $650 one way on Christmas Eve. That was probably the only appealing thing from the trip. The aircraft inside were rather dirty, finger prints and grease all over the windows, the cabin had an aweful smell as well. The seat space was okay. The inflight entertainment was updated and had a good selection. The food was nothing to get excited about, and the crew only came twice during the whole flight which is below the amount of times they come on other services I've flown between Sydney and Vancouver. The crew overall were okay, spoke hardly any English and weren't apologetic if they hit you with the trolley.

Yes, you still need to check yourself and your baggage in at Xiamen again but ground staff seem to be used to the procedure by now. In Amsterdam and in Taipei they understood they could only tag our bags to Xiamen. In Xiamen when arriving at customs it's best to have printed proof you're transferring but they have a list of transferring passengers. There's a counter for free hotel if your wait is longer than 6 hours. Don't confuse this counter with the ""transfer service"" counter that's right next to it, that's only for domestic transfers, I mistakingly waited in that line for some time. The hotel is 20 minutes by taxi but it's nice. One awkward thing is that they put 2 solo passengers into one room, luckily I didn't have any roommate. On the long flight both ways they ran out of coconut juice halfway. On Xiamen to Taipei they gave drinks only after the food, so you had to eat either thirsty or with cold food. On Taipei to Xiamen they didn't give any drinks at all but maybe that was because I had ordered a special meal when booking. China has some strict rules about mobile phones and power banks. On the site it says you can do online checkin if you fly from Amsterdam but I got an error when I tried, maybe that only works if you're not transferring.

This airline is ridiculous and so are the airport procedures in Xiamen. Me and my boyfriend had booked a flight from Amsterdam to Bangkok via Xiamen for an insanely good price of €370. Xiamen does not allow online check in for international flights. At the baggage drop in AMS, we asked whether the luggage could be tagged to our final destination. No proper answer could be given. Finally, at the gate we were told to pick up our luggage in Xiamen and drop it off again there. The flight itself was pretty good, except for the food which had no taste at all. Horrible. This airline does not allow any mobile phones to be turned on. Not even when they are on airplane mode. They need to be switched off, and if they find out you secretly use your phone the crew will stand next to you until you switch it off. WiFi may be used on iPads and Notebooks only. After a few hours the crew handed out arrivals / departure cards and you will need them. The crew will tell you that you won't need them for transiting however, you do need them. You will be put back in line at immigration if you don't have them filled out. Every single person has to go through immigration, even when your next flight is in 30 minutes or so. The horror really started when arriving in Xiamen. The procedure is as follows: Get out of the airplane. Walk towards customs via declare or not declare route. Go through immigration (with arrivals / departure card, passport, eticket) and you will get a temporary entrance permission. Go to baggage belt and get your luggage. Put your luggage through x-ray. Take elevator one level up. Now it gets tricky. If you have a 6 hours or more transit. Proceed to (transfer service) counter B11 for a FREE hotel. You do need to pay for travel costs. The hotel was good, but checking in took 45-60 minutes, they are so slow and don't understand English. After that return to the airport to the departures floor. Proceed to Intl. departures. Put your luggage through x-ray. Now you will find the check in counters, check in your flights and luggage. Walk upstairs and go through immigration (hand over your departures card and passport). Go through hand luggage check (they have very strict rules for power banks). If the power bank itself doesn't show its capacity it will be thrown away. No argument possible. Now proceed to the gate to your airplane that will bring you to your next destination. Never I will fly with Xiamen Airlines again.

22981,Xiamen Airlines,3,"""transferring in Xiamen was ridiculous""",12th May 2016,False," My family and I travelled from Beijing To Taipei Songshan (TSA), and Taipei TPE to Beijing, both times with Xiamen Airlines in Economy class. The Good - compared to other Chinese airlines, we found the food and drinks service to be much better. The legroom on the Boeing 787 from PEK to XMN and vice-versa was very good, and the staff were friendly. An OK selection of IFE was provided on the 787 including a range of English speaking movies and many games. On 3 of the 4 flights the kids were handed an activity pack which they enjoyed playing (for about 10 minutes). The Bad - legroom on the 737 between Xiamen and Taiwan was poor. Transferring in Xiamen in both directions was ridiculous. When we checked in at Beijing, our bags were tagged through to Taipei, however we were advised that we had to go to a separate counter at Xiamen to get our boarding passes for the flight from Xiamen to Tiapei. It was not easy to find where this was once we got to Xiamen, there were no instructions nor staff to assist. Once we found the counter we were told that it didn’t open until 2 hours before the flight (we had a 3 hour layover), and there was nowhere available to sit and wait. Taking this in our stride, it was like a “red rag to a bull” when as soon as we boarded the flight to Taipei they showed us a video promoting how good Skyteam was, with their “Seamless transfer service”. It was worse when returning from Taipei. The bags could only be tagged to Xiamen, and boarding passes could only be provided to Xiamen. There was no specific transfer facility for connecting passengers that we could use to re-check bags onwards to Beijing, and no instructions whatsoever provided to assist in the transfer. Fortunately we live in mainland China so could find our way around the system, however it would have been utterly confusing for passengers who had never been to China before, with no assistance provided. If Xiamen Airlines has aspirations of being a true regional and international player, it needs to revisit its transfer services through Xiamen and replicate those of other successful airlines in performing transfers. Its part-parent airline China Southern does a dramatically better job handling passengers through Guangzhou.",Boeing 787 / Boeing 737,Family Leisure,Economy Class,PEK to TSA via XMN,May 2016,3.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,,2.0,no
22982,Xiamen Airlines,5,"""meals were exactly the same""",10th May 2016,False,"  Flew from Amsterdam to Tokyo via Xiamen on Xiamen Airlines. No seat reservation or online check-in is possible with this airline. The KLM ground staff were unaware of the transit procedure in XMN. They told us to tag our bags to NRT but apparently it had to be picked up in XMN to be checked-in again. The flight on the Dreamliner to XMN was good. Loadfactor about 40% so a whole row of seats for myself. Food was served 1 hour after takeoff and 5 hours after takeoff. On both services meals were exactly the same. Didn't see the crew for the last 5 hours of the flight. Entertainment system had hiccups all the time and wifi was not available on frame B-2769. Flight was on time. Transfer procedure at XMN is troublesome. Crew on the plane told us not to fill out the immigration form since we were only transiting. At the immigration we were send back to the end of the queue to fill out the immigration form. We also had to deliver a paper version of the ticket with our names to the immigration which we did not have. They didn't thrust the itinerary in the CheckMyTrip app. After a lot of discussion they provided us the 24-hours visa for China. Don't follow the signs to the departure hall immediately if you have a long layover. The check-in desks are located in a secure area without any restaurants or shops. Check-in was opened 2 hours before departure and we couldn't get back to other parts of the airport from security. So waiting on some steel couches for a few hours without anything to do. The flight to NRT on an old and worn B738 was delayed for 90 minutes. Sitting on the tarmac without air-conditioning for 60 minutes. No reason for the delay was given. Food was good on this flight however. I had a bad experience on the flight from NRT to XMN. It was said to be a non smoking flight, but not for the crew. All of a sudden the seatbelt signs went on without any obvious reason and the smell of cigarette smoke appeared from the air-conditioning system. After 5 minutes the smell of smoke disappeared and the fast seatbelt sign was switched off again. This happened 3 times on the 4 hour flight. Having learned from my previous transfer at XMN, it went smoother this time. Altough not possible to buy food at XMN since creditcards were not accepted and the ATM's were out of order. The flight to AMS on the 787 was packed this time. Chinese people carry lots of hand luggage so overhead bins filled up quickly. I skipped the first meal because I wanted to sleep. The flight did arrive on time in Amsterdam.","Boeing 788, Boeing 738",Business,Economy Class,AMS to NRT via XMN,May 2016,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,4.0,no

The Boeing 787 the same as the one on my way to Taipei. Both flights were on time. We had a constant turbulence on the first couple hours on the second leg of my journey, so the meal service was suspended accordingly. The flight attendants acted quickly as soon as we flew in a clean air again and resumed the meal service. There were a significant number of babies/toddlers on the flight to Amsterdam and most of them were crying and screaming constantly.

Also, they didn't transfer my baggage directly, so once in Xiamen, I had to get my baggage and check out, and then check my baggage in again.

What's worse the first segment (domestic) of the flight opens its check-in 1.5 hrs before it opens for int'l passengers (they can check in even earlier online) so the 5 of us we were almost given seats far apart. When passing immigration at Dalian you felt it was quite informal. And then you pass a formal immigration at Xiamen again. Equipment was B738 what you may not expect to sit in for seven plus hours. Seat pitch was no different than any domestic. No PTV poor TV programme. Dinner was OK coming with bread pickled snack and fruit.

23007,XL Airways France,1,"""will not fly with them again""",11th August 2019,False,"  My family and I traveled this summer from Austin to Miami, two cities in Colombia, Madrid, France, and New York. We used multiple airlines and took carry-on bags on all of them. We are a family of four, and each of us took a carry-on suitcase. The bags qualified for carrying on in all of the airlines that we used, except for this one. Ridiculous enough, the trip that we used XL airways was an international trip from Paris to New York. At the airport, XL airways had a small compartment to measure the bags that they said the bag needed to fit in, including the wheels. It seems like they were doing this scam often enough because when we were boarding there were three guys ready to take ""the bags that people couldn't take as carry-ons"" in the plane. The representative told us that it was going to be $100 euros per bag and they took our passports and put us aside with many other people who were going through the same thing we were going through. They pretty much kept us until everyone boarded and told us that if we were going to take the flight, we needed to pay 65 euros per bag and he acted like he was doing us a favor. This was our flight to come home from a long trip, it was really late at night, and we had our six and nine year old exhausted kids with us, so we didn't see any other option than to pay them for the four bags. This is what they have on their website to pay for checked in bags. Also, during boarding time I have never seen an airline as disorganized as this one. There were no lines and they just called everyone at once. Inside the plane, there was no entertainment and the plane inside was very uncomfortable for a trans-atlantic trip. The only bright spot was that the crew was really nice to us, and they served one hot meal during the flight. Do not fly with this airline, they are not worth it, and if it is a family trip, even worse. Here are the measurements that most airlines advertise as carry on: 22 x 14 x 9 in And here is theirs: 21.7 in high X 13.8 in wide X 9.8 in deep. They are not really that much different. We had measured them before we left for the airport, as well as had carried them on several flights previously.

23011,XL Airways France,1,"""never fly this airline again""",10th June 2019,True,"  Paris to New York. The absolute worst airline I’ve ever flown! If you are looking for a stressful experience book your flight with this airline! To begin with when leaving NY for a much anticipated trip we accidentally brought an expired passport. I know horrible mistake! Since we arrived well ahead of time I thought I’d call a friend to get my current passport and bring it to the airport for me which would take less than 1 hour. The agent at the desk said we must have the passport an hour before take off. He gave me a phone number to call to see what would happen if I didn’t get the passport in time. I called and nobody answered. I told the agent then he said yes well they don’t reopen until 9am so that didn’t help much. My friend got my passport to me about 55 minutes prior to the flight departure time and they refused to let us check in. I was told the check in was closed because the check in staff needed to leave the counter to go downstairs to start boarding. If they had enough employees I would have been in that flight. It gets worse! So we missed the flight then called 9am when customer service reopened and I was told they couldn’t do anything to help me. If I wanted they would sell me new tickets for the same price for the following day. I had non refundable hotel reservations and already lost one night. Was so upset with this airline that I decided to just book a different airline for less money to get to Pairs. In the return trip my experience wasn’t much better! We got to the airport with plenty of time To spare and found XL Airways counter but no employees were there. A sign said they were closed? No further information given! We walked around to find out they were set up in a different spot. Not sure why they couldn’t have put up a sign telling us where to go. Other passengers were walking around just as confused and annoyed as us. After checking in our luggage and weighing our carry on luggage we went to the boarding area. When boarding the plane we got stopped and were told our carry on was too big. I explained that the lady at check-in weighed it for us and said it was under the allowable weight. Then the woman at boarding said no actually your daughters tote is too large. It was a fabric shopping bag with a neck pillow, some snacks and a sweater. I showed her that if you squeeze it, it scrunches up so small and it would have no problem fitting under a seat. She wasn’t allowing it at all. She said if we didn’t pay $100 for the extra bag that we couldn’t get on the plane. $100 for a shopping bag! We flew throughout Europe on several airlines with the same luggage and never encountered this issue! Not even with airlines that have a lower weight limit. This woman stopped another lady at the boarding gate. We couldn’t get on the plane unless we paid the $100! What could we do? We were now minutes before departure and needed to get home.

The flight was okay, but when we arrived in Guadeloupe our suitcases where not there. A long way of bad communication followed and eventually we did not get our suitcases for the whole trip. Eventually the suitcases arrived in Brussels, while we live in the Netherlands and they refused to bring then to us. We had to get them ourself. We are still trying to get a compensation for the fact we did not have our suitcases for the whole trip (over two weeks) and then waiting months to get them after the trip. They do not respond, offer just a couple off bucks, while airlines have fixed compensations they should pay in these cases.

The excuse given was the plane hit the gangplank and damaged a wing so a smaller plane was sent. Having 150 passengers in JFK. They knew at 5pm there was an issue yet let us stand in line from 9pm to midnight allowing passengers to board with criteria. It appeared it was who yelled the loudest. They in fact paid three days hotel which is how long it took to get the next flight. And in line many not involved in our error were also carried over from other flights. According to the hotel staff the airline knew at 5pm there was an issue. Yet we were made to stand for three hours. So now they have my confirmation. They paid my hotel, yet I have to prove I went on the rescheduled flight by giving them my boarding pass. A e-ticket from my original ticket is not enough.

Bad the seats are not very comfortable especially for a long haul flight ok for a day flight but not for a night flight. There is a wifi entertainment system where you can watch entertainment, see info about destinations (which does not have any use due to the limited information) and flight tracking. Of course there is an upgraded option available for 10 EUR. Food was very average. Drink options good but have to pay.

When I got to the airport, there was no one from XL airways there. Over 150 passengers were waiting for a flight that never arrived. The worst part is that I tried getting in touch with the airline in New York and in France and there was no answer. The airline did not even have the decency to send me an email or text that there was no flight. The first time I heard from the airline was Tuesday night informing me that my flight will be leaving Thursday afternoon. It was so unprofessional and honestly appalling. The airline did not value any of the people’s time and did not even care to correspond with passengers until two days later.

There were no email or text updates about the delays in the flight therefore I traveled to the airport at the appropriate time only to find no information and no XL Airways staff. This is is inexcusable to have no reps in person and the only phone number we could reach was a french number which incurred international charges. The only reason I even found the number to call was because other passengers said they had found some announcements on the XL airways website. Why none of us could be informed via phone, email or any representatives in person is beyond me. How hard is it to send one email blast out to all passengers saying ""We apologize for the inconvenience, please check our website for updates and we will continue to share news with you as soon as we have it. Thank you for your patience"". Again I understand that the weather and the pipe burst are extenuating circumstances however it is within XL Airlines capabilities and responsibilities to communicate effectively with passengers and have a plan in case of such events that severely inconvenience so many people.

23018,XL Airways France,1,XL Airways France customer review,8th January 2018,True,"  New York to Paris. This is truly the absolute worst airline.  They are unresponsive, incompetent, and unequivocally rude. They do not have representatives at the airport and the staff that they do employ refuse to answer customer's questions. I was scheduled to leave on a flight 2 days ago at 9:30 pm. The flight's gate kept being changed for hours after the departure time until it was ultimately CANCELLED around 2 am. Then, they had us stand in the line waiting for a representative to speak to each traveler individually about rescheduling our flights. We waited in this line until 4 am without anyone being spoken to. Then, they made an announcement that they had hotels reserved for us and that we were just waiting for buses to take us there. An hour later, they noted that no buses were on the way and that there were no hotel rooms reserved. They did not provide us with water or answers/information as to when our flight was being rescheduled to. The staff members insulted passengers calling us rude, disrespectful, and annoying for voicing our concern and frustration. They refused to speak to us and did not answer a single question. We could not leave the airport because they would not release our luggage. After we were forced to sleep on the bare floor of the airport, they said that the flight would be rescheduled to the next day at 7:30 pm. We lined up for check in at 4:30, as instructed. The XL representatives/staff members said that we were ""misbehaving"" so they chose to delay check in until 6 pm. We finally checked in. The flight was re-listed as being scheduled for 9:30 pm. We waited at the gate until 11:30, when they claimed that they were commencing boarding. We stood in line waiting for boarding until 12:45 pm. At this time, they CANCELLED the flight again. Then, XL threatened to have any passengers that complained or showed anger arrested. They instructed us to go pick up our luggage at the carousel. We went to the carousel, where we waited until 4 am. At 4 am, we were told that no luggage would be released to us, and that no other information would be given. I left the airport. I received an email at 3:00 pm notifying me that the flight was scheduled for 2:00 am the following morning. Then, this flight was also cancelled. 3 flights cancelled. They still have our luggage.

23021,XL Airways France,1,"""attentive and very friendly""",31st August 2017,False,"  Paris to Los Angeles. I was skeptical about flying with this airline before I booked. I had read prior reviews and the ratings were very low. I felt that I should contribute with regards to the overall service that I received from XL Airways. My fare was excellent. I paid more for connecting within Europe then flying across the world.  Crew, attentive and very friendly. I received lunch, dinner and snack, as well as headphones. Basic water, tea and coffee provided with meals and throughout the flight. Anything else, needed to be paid for. I understood that before I booked. It's a low cost airline so basic caffinated drinks and or specialty drinks as well as blankets incur an extra charge. The blanket came in a colorful pouch with a blow up half moon pillow and eye mask, for 8 Euros. Credit cards are accepted onboard. They provided duty free purchases before landing. As for Internet, there was a fee to watch movies and listen to music for 9.95. You needed to download the airlines app before departure. If you didn't want to purchase internet to view and listen to music/movies, the aircraft did have three tv's on the plane, in which they played 3 movies and a travel documentary on a particular destination for the long flight. I found the movies entertaining and family oriented. The seats were comfortable for me but of course just average, it's economy class. So please consider this if you are tall! If you need extra legroom, economy plus for an extra fee is available before confirming your flight. The aircraft was very clean and facilities were positioned properly on the aircraft with several almost available at a time. The last check-in was an hour before departure, so get there early. No exceptions are made and is a strict policy that the airline adheres to.  I witnessed two customers that tried checking in 6 mins after the airline closed the check in counters and were still denied check in. As for carry on, strict 5kg allowance, one personal hand bag and one carry on only. If you exceeded the 5kg weight, the bag is checked to your destination but with no additional fee to do so, which is nice. I'll definitely use XL Airways again in the future. I found the airline to be great for the overall. I was very pleased with their services! I have a disability and the crew was wonderful in accommodating me and making sure I had proper assistance before boarding and when we arrived to the final destination.

Some of these reviews for XL I feel are from people that expected too much for a budget airline. I read the instructions and recommendations from their website, which I would read entirely to help you have a better experience. When I arrived at the airport I had my boarding pass printed before hand and was quickly greeted by an XL employee. They checked my passport and they checked the weight and size of my luggage. I had to check my luggage in the system, because the weight was too high. Upon boarding I was greeted by a very professional and flight attendants who spoke English and French. They realized I didn't speak French and directed me to my seat. Upon departing they did the standard procedures in French and English for departure. During the flight they provided a blanket, earplugs, water and a free meal! This is a very French airline and the food was very French and flavorful. They were very accommodating for refills of water, tea, and coffee that were free. The airplane itself is older so there is no WIFI onboard for internet. I was not disappointed, because they did provide a free movie and I also had my IPad. I would recommend you take a portable charger for your phone, tablet, or laptop. There are not electrical plugs on the seats for your electronic devices.

23025,XL Airways France,2,"""I am horrified by the service""",26th July 2017,False,"  
If you are tempted to fly with this airline because of the wonderful price do not do it. The flight out to Paris was wonderful. The plane was empty so everyone had their own row to relax. The troubles didn't start until we arrived in Paris. On our flight to Paris they lost our babies car seat. When we went to check in today the lady at the counter was rude and unfriendly. We handed her 5 passports. Three for adults and two children. We had 4 bags to check in a stroller and we had our 2 year olds car seat. We have a double stroller. I was holding our ten month old and our two year old was sleeping in the stroller. In San Francisco they put stickers on all three pieces because the stroller breaks down into three pieces. When we told her that the stroller did that she rolled her eyes and said really. Then we tried to check in our two year olds car seat she said nope you can't take it, or you have to pay for it. When I explained they hadn't charged us for it in San Francisco she said well that is San Francisco. She then called the airline and they said we had to pay 50€ for the seat. She told us we had to go to a separate counter to pay then come back to her. As we were leaving she said wait let me put the stickers on the stroller. As she was putting the sticker on one of the pieces she noticed our daughter and said oh you have another child, we said yes, you have her passport to which she then said oh you don't have to pay anymore. Instead of apologizing she just said your finished. We upgraded to seats 4 thinking they would be wonderful seats because of our previous flight. But the seats had less space than before! They were so uncomfortable! Especially having a twenty pound baby on your lap. There was a section in front of us nobody knew was available. When I finally got the attention again of a stewardess the doors were being closed and she said that I needed to go to the gate to pay. What kind of airline charges for everything other than water, coffee and tea but wont let you buy up a seat? There were 8 seats open! Those seats remained open all flight. Our ten month old was walking back and forth in front of our seats holding onto the seats. We didn't notice but there was an ashtray in our daughters seat. In it was trash with liquid and food. It stuck and was disgusting. Our son put his hand in it. When I asked the stewardess to do something about it, she said you think it's my problem? I said to her I am not saying you own the airplane but you are the only one who's really able to do anything because you have the access to things to clean it. She rolled her eyes at me. 6 minutes later another stewardess came with gloves and took out the trash and in the process got liquid on us and said there I got everything. She went and got a napkin dabbed and said there I am done and walked away. 6th thing, for a couple hours service was non existent. We were trying to make a bottle for our ten month old so he could sleep and we pushed the service button but nobody came for 30 minutes.

23026,XL Airways France,8,"""nice and smiling staff""",11th July 2017,False," Flight Los Angeles - Paris with XL Airways. June 2017. First of all, when rating a low cost airline, I need to compare it to other low cost airlines and not to Emirates for example. When you book low cost, you should know what to expect: you know that for such a low price, you're not gonna have the high quality you want (for that, you go with Air France and pay $1,500 instead of $600). So, that being said, for a low cost airline XL is really good on several points, but of course some are not. Good points: - the free checked-in bag! Yes, that makes the whole difference, because most low cost airlines makes you pay for it, which then drags the final price up. So that was appreciated. The free meals in-flight. We were given full meals in flight. In addition to that, we were given free coffee / tea, and refreshments as well. Only alcohol is in addition. Food quality: good! I will not say amazing, no, but for in-flight food, it's pretty good. Very similar to the food quality you will get in Air France flights. This is because XL Airways is a French airline, so good products. Trust me after this you will be full, but if you want more, they have a menu with French items, delicious. - the staff. The staff was amazing, really. I think the best service I had on a flight. They are not after you to buy things (which I experienced in most low cost airlines). They were so helpful and dedicated. They give you extra bread, and do not hesitate to serve you twice for refreshment when asked. Overall very nice and smiling staff. Negative points - the seats. I would say the seats are my main and only complaint. They are very tiny, and not too comfortable. I'm a small size woman, so it was ok for me, but the poor guy seating next to me had a hard time. His knees were literally touching the seat up front, so not the best for a long haul flight. This is where you feel that you are in a low cost airline in case you forgot, here's the reminder. - the in-flight entertainment. So, they don't have in-seat screens. However, they do have in-flight entertainment through iPads or other devices. You can access their entertainment through your computer, or they rent iPads for $15 (which also include the premium package). Not a big selection of movies, but enough for a long haul flight. Personally, I enjoyed reading a book better, and also download my own favorite series before leaving to enjoy during the flight. Overall: for the price, I will use this airline again. Mainly because I do a lot of Los Angeles-Paris, and the direct flight, with checked in baggage and meals included is just awesome..",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Paris,June 2017,2.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,5.0,yes

Yes the seats are crammed in there and the entertainment is not great. There is wifi and you can watch movies on your iPad. (They also rent ipad minis for $20 so bring your own!). I read a little and tried to sleep so this wasn't a deal breaker for me given the reasonable fare. If want more leg room, you pay dearly ($70 extra) but this is worth it for me.

We arrived at JFK 3 hours early and were among the first in line to check in. After waiting in line for an hour, we made it to the counter where our back bags and checked bags were carefully weighed. Thank goodness, we were all underneath the required mass. The plane was boarded and we we got on the electricity went completely out but in a few minutes, we were on our way. The pilot did an excellent job piloting the plane and even though we took off late, we made it close to our normal time. After spending a few days in Paris, we went back to check in to our return flight but they had already boarded and we missed our flight. We tried calling customer service but only got a recording and wasn't until the next day that we found out we would have to purchase a one way ticket home. On the way back after Checking in for our one way flight back to the US, the woman at the counter was not sympathetic just said so sorry. We did make it home safely and once again the pilot did an excellent job. Bottom Line: I would take this airline again but make sure that I made the flight next time because you will not be compensated or offered a discount. By the way, I thought the food served on board was really good!

The aircraft seemed to be a really old plane, and the TV's were broken (this plane did not feature individual screens on the back of the seats). But the flight itself wasn't the worst flight I've ever been on. The service was ok, and the food was edible. It is, after all, a budget flight. I would also like to mention that the captain did a great job piloting the plane. My issue with XL Airways is their customer service. We had checked in an oversized luggage at CDG, paid the fees, and followed the standard procedures of checking in. When we arrived at JFK, our oversized luggage was nowhere to be found. The staff at the terminal 4 oversized baggage claim counter told us that we just need to wait. We waited for 2 hours before someone finally told us that most likely it didn't make it onto our flight. We filed a claim, and they provided us with a phone number to contact to track our lost luggage. The number is completely bogus. We tried calling during business hours (8AM - 10PM weekdays) after ringing for about 3 minutes, it goes to voicemail, which is conveniently full. We try reaching XL Airways through several means, and finally we manage to speak to a representative. The representative tells us that we need to send an email with a detailed list of the items in the lost luggage. We do so, and wait for a reply. After doing a bit of research, I find a review dated 2013 about a lost luggage through XL Airways from CDG to JFK. The reviewer finally managed to track down their suitcase by going directly to JFK. So we decide to do the same and drove back to the airport to Terminal 4. After speaking to TSA, they tell us to speak to an XL Airways representative at their ticketing counter in departures. We make our way there only to be told that we need to go back downstairs to lost and found. Finally someone from Swissport baggage transport helps us track down our lost luggage, and we finally receive it. Nobody from XL Airways would provide us with any type of information regarding our lost luggage. They have a compensation policy of 20 euros per kilo for lost luggages, which wouldn't have even covered the cost of the suitcase itself. They have zero respect for their customer's belongings, which is completely unacceptable. Furthermore, no one from XL Airways was willing to help us in the least. They kept sending us to dead ends, and it wasn't until we showed up at the airport the following day that we received any answers (none of which came from XL Airways). This review should serve as a warning to anyone looking to fly with XL Airways. They have a 5kg weight limit for carry on luggage, and a 20kg weight limit for checked in luggage. First checked in luggage is free, after that it's 100 euros per bag. They also don't respect your belongings. To them, you aren't a customer that deserves respect, you are just a sold seat. I will never fly with them again, and their aircrafts need to be updated desperately. They should have been out of circulation years ago. I would not recommend this airline.

23031,XL Airways France,3,"""budget airline with minimal service""",12th July 2016,False,"Los Angeles to Paris CDG with XL Airways. This is a budget airline with minimal service. If you can accept no frills service of getting you to your destination then this might be for you. If you are used to full service airlines such as American, Delta, Southwest, United etc then don't take this airline unless you can deal with the following - narrow seats, poor customer service, difficult website, very restrictive baggage weights. We did it. It worked for us. We kept our bags to 20 kg checked (42 lbs) and 11 lbs (cabin) I strongly suggest you buy a travel scale for like $6 from Amazon. We made a mistake and paid extra for the exit row on our outbound flight. Lots of leg room, but the arm rests are fixed and don't go up like in all other rows. This loses you 2.5 inches in width. Having those extra inches helps. Our flight was only 2/3 full and most people don't pay for the seat selection. I suggest you do. Getting pinned into a middle seat or window seat and having to climb over someone on the tight seats is tough. This was the cheapest ticket for the busy summer season at $1120 round trip. My rating is low because service does matter. Website is poor in my opinion. We could not book return flight seats without calling airline since website did not let us do it after we booked outbound flight seats.

23032,XL Airways France,7,"""service was really good""",5th July 2016,False," San Francisco to Paris with XL Airways France. I was really concerned after reading all the negative reviews and was pleasantly surprised to have a good experience. There were 3 of us and the money savings was a lot. Since we saved so much, I upgraded our seats to more legroom, very reasonably priced. On the way back, we were able to get an emergency row for the 3 of us, $50 each. The service going and coming back was really good. We had a meal, snacks, coffee, tea, and water free. Of course, there was other stuff for sale like on all flights. Legroom in general is not that different from most of the major US airlines, seat width is pretty narrow. The video entertainment is bad, but they do rent tablets with videos, games and documentaries for €10.00, well worth it. Even with all the extras, it was still a big savings. The worst part of XL is their online booking. It's easy to book your tickets, but if you have any questions, forget getting hold of someone. Reserving your seats - only if your lucky. I was able to book our seats about 3 weeks before our trip from SFO to Paris, but not return. When we went to the airport to check in I asked about getting return seats, they said ask in Paris, they couldnt. Paris said, you can't reserve seats until day of flight. We got to the airport about 2.5 hours prior to flight and easily reserved our seats. On our departure flight I noticed a lot of people angry about an extra charge for overweight luggage. Its shown everywhere what the weight limit is, so we didnt have any issues. The weight limit is very reasonable, 44lbs for a check in bag (no charge) and 5kg which is about 11lbs for carry on. If you've got the money to spend at least $400 and more for each ticket for an airlines with more frills go for it, but I think you would have to pay at least $600 more to really feel the difference.

Both flights were on time. Fare was a steal at $700. I haven't seen anything this cheap in years. Staff was extremely professional, both in flight and gate staff. Plane was in good condition. Tiny seats, I am 5'3"" and didn't have too much problem. However my boyfriend is 6'0"" and was miserable. The passenger in front reclined his seat and was basically sitting in my boyfriend's lap for 7 hours. Their website is horrible - after the first leg of my trip, I wised up and was trying to reserve extra legroom seats on the website but kept getting error messages and ultimately was not able to. This was absolutely infuriating. After all those errors on the website, I tried to call their customer service for help but only got voicemail. Absolutely infuriating. Good luck if you need any help after you book. No inflight entertainment. The power outlet at our seats worked only intermittently. Make every effort to charge your devices before boarding the plane.

Boarding of the flight began, and then the flight was cancelled - without explanation at 11:45 p.m. The staff asked for patience, but no information was given to the passengers until after 1:00 am. The reason for the cancellation was that the airline overworked the flight crew. This is something that could have been determined by 8:00pm, but the majority of the passengers did not get a hotel until 3:00 am due to the overwhelming incompetence of the staff of this airline. They did not assist, offer information, they were rude, condescending and complained to the rightly frustrated customers that we were somehow ungrateful for their efforts to not get us to Paris on Christmas Eve.

I called them immediately and they told me I should call their booking office in Paris. After getting the runaround to obtain their phone number, I managed to talk to a lady in France and I explained to her that I live in New York and I will be leaving from JFK. I asked her to reverse the itinerary, to make it JFK-Paris. She said there was nothing she could do about it and that she will submit the request to her boss. After many calls, I got from them an email address where I should send my request to correct the itinerary; which I did. After 4 or 5 days they replied to deny my request. However, after calling many more times, they agreed that if I buy 2 new tickets (JFK-Paris) from their site and send them the proof of it (?) they would reimburse me for the erroneously issued tickets for Paris-JFK. I bought 2 new tickets from their site, mind you each at $200 more than the initial ticket price, and sent them the proof of purchase, and they reimbursed me. The day of departure, at check in, they informed me that they only allow 40 lb per ticket (instead of the usual 50 lb per ticket) and they charged me $140 for the 20 lb excess baggage.  On the plane, you get charged $14 for a blanket, $7 per drink, and $5 for earphone to listen to music or movie. When I initially bought my tickets from them, I thought I had a good deal, saving $300 on 2 tickets over Air France's price. However, XL Airways were unimaginably rude and unfair, and they will find every excuse to deny you your due to charge you more,  and likely incentivise their employees to extract the max from clients. At the end it was mega bad deal as it cost me $250 more than if I flew with Air France and minus AF courteous service and always ready to accommodate you attitude and the perks on board: super food, good wine and free blankets, earphones, movies etc. ",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,JFK to CDG,September 2015,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no

Understanding that XL Airways France is a budget airline, my expectations weren't particularly high, but they failed to provide even the most basic level of comfort and hygiene. The smell inside the aircraft was quite terrible.  They're able to offer a lower price by fitting more people onto each flight. I'm not a large person by anyone's standards, but I found myself constricted by the width of the seat and squashed against the passenger to my left. Not ideal on a 7 hour flight. The aircraft had no overhead vents and the temperature was too high. No pillows are offered, and I think it's unreasonable to suggest that pillows aboard an international flight are a luxury. This is the first international flight I've been on that didn't offer a small pillow or blanket.  The bathroom was a disgrace.  The attendant did his best to mask the smell with some kind of spray, but it hardly helped. At no point was water offered to passengers during the flight. Again, it'd be absurd to suggest that basic refreshments are a luxury. What makes all of this worse is that I paid an additional $70 I paid for a 'seat upgrade'.

We were fed a breakfast an hour before landing and arrived right on time. Luggage came out quickly. On the way back the plane was not as full and at check-in we were able to get and aisle and window seat with the middle blocked out. Which made for another comfortable flight.

After an 8.5 hr flight we sat on the runway for 1 hour because there was nowhere to park according to the pilot. After getting through customs it took nearly 30 minutes for the bag carousel to start. So about an hour and 45 minutes after landing I finally get my bag. My girlfriends bag wasn't in the first round of bags. We had to wait another half an hour before the carousel started up again. I can only assume they have one cart and a small group of bag handlers. In short we landed at 10pm and left the airport at 12.40. I will pay for a real airline in the future - it's worth the extra few hundred bucks. On top of that the seats are very small and have zero leg room the inflight entertainment was poor and they charged me for a half a cup of soda.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,3.0,,1.0,,2.0,no
23060,XL Airways France,8,XL Airways France customer review,21st November 2013,False,Yes XL seats are average size and yes there is little in-flight entertainment. Actually I found the flight far better than many I've had recently and XL far exceeded my experience flying from Europe on American Airlines several months prior. The staff are quite congenial and helpful. The plane is clean and the service quite acceptable. Airline travel these days is not fun and unless you are flying first class few airlines meet the acceptable experience we had on XL. So if you want to get to Paris with some money in your wallet enjoy reading napping or other means of self-entertainment and are not obese then I highly recommend this airlines. The comments complaining about XL's service are clearly from customers who like to complain. Flying XL is just fine so do it.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,,2.0,,5.0,yes
23061,XL Airways France,n,XL Airways France customer review,15th October 2013,False,JFK-CDG. Once at the airport you will take your luggage to the shadiest check-in counter then navigate your way to the most isolated gate at your terminal. Your interaction with staff will be brief and to the point. XL does not win any medals for hospitality. But the planes are all throw-aways from second-tier airlines. You may find that you're travelling in say a Garuda Airlines plane from the 80's. The seating arrangement on XL is probably in violation of at least a dozen FAA regulations and if not it should be. Where seats are normally arranged in rows of 2-4-2 this airline opted for a novel 3-3-3 set-up. This adds an extra seat to each row but unfortunately the back of each seat is practically glued to the back of the adjacent seat and as a result the armrests between seats have nowhere to lift. You will be squeezed in so tightly that if you're even moderately overweight forget it: you won't fit. If you're taller than 6 feet you will probably hurt your knees back and/or neck staying in a contorted position for 7 hours. The seats don't really recline with the exception of a few broken ones that recline too much. The rows are so close to each other that a laptop won't open with sufficient clearance to let you type on it. The food will be nothing short of revolting but you should expect that. Bring your own water: the one you can purchase on board costs $3 for a 16-oz bottle. Want coffee? That will be another $3. They say you get what you pay for. Sometimes however the bargain is just not worth it.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,,2.0,,3.0,no
23062,XL Airways France,n,XL Airways France customer review,24th September 2013,False,"We were booked on a flight from CDG to JFK on Sep 23 2013 at 07.30 pm. Before heading to the airport I called to find out what terminal and was told terminal 4 by an XL representative. When we arrived at CDG there was no terminal 4 and know one knew where to find their counter. I tried calling again but was disconnected several times. When we finally made it to 2A and there wasn't anyone there to help since it was 40 minutes before the scheduled departure. I called and was informed that terminal 4 was wrong but that it was 1A which she later corrected to 2A. I'm certain that the representative didn't purposefully give us wrong information but that information caused us to miss our flight. I requested for customer service to put us on the next available flight but was told ""After considering your request we are sorry to inform you that we will not be able to give you a positive answer.""

23063,XL Airways France,n,XL Airways France customer review,12th September 2013,False,"I had booked a flight Catania to Paris non stop months ago. I booked the flight because it was a non stop. A week before the flight I received an email telling me that the flight had been changed and would now stop in Palermo before going to Paris and would therefore arrive Paris at 02.10 in the morning and would take twice as long! I called them to try to cancel the flight. It cost me close to 10 dollars because they have a phone number which charges you for waiting on the line. They then told me that the flight was still technically a non stop flight as the stop in Palermo was merely ""technical"" (whatever that means) and that as the arrival was less than 2 hours later than originally planned they did not have to reimburse me. I will never use this company again.",,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,,1.0,no
23064,XL Airways France,9,XL Airways France customer review,27th August 2013,False,Just returned after a trip with family to Paris from JFK. Check-in with e-ticket was no hassle. No pre-selection available but they were good in making sure that family was seated together. Be aware of size and weight limits on baggage but we didn't have problems. Seats no different than other carriers. The crew was professional and accommodating. The flights left and arrived on time. The food was typical airline stuff. All considered wouldn't hesitate to travel with XL again. Saved nearly $2500 by using them.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,,4.0,,5.0,yes
23065,XL Airways France,1,XL Airways France customer review,4th August 2013,False,MIA-CDG. The seats uncomfortable and you could not move since the space between the seats was ridiculously small. Seating upright my knee touched the seat in front of me. You cannot get a seat assignment before checking in. The check in is very Slow. The baggage allowance are under all other airlines.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,0.0,,0.0,,2.0,no
23066,XL Airways France,9,XL Airways France customer review,14th July 2013,False,New York JFK - Paris CDG 3 July. Was pleasantly surprised. As someone who travels a lot I was impressed by how much of an effort FA's made to be nice. The seats were a bit small but not more than most airlines these days and they were modern and clean. The meal was just okay but I was not that hungry and the coffee was delicious. The money I saved was well worth it!,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,,0.0,,5.0,yes
23067,XL Airways France,8,XL Airways France customer review,9th June 2013,False,Our trip was fine. XL got us to Paris and back earlier this month with no drama. The flight was very smooth and our party of six easily saved $3000 over what the major carriers charge on this route. The cabin crew gets high praise for their professionalism and courtesy. We would definitely fly XL again.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,,3.0,,5.0,yes
23068,XL Airways France,7,XL Airways France customer review,19th May 2013,False,JFK-CDG. Flight left at midnight. New aircraft. No meal after take off breakfast at landing - which was of better quality than I've been served on many American carriers. At other times drinks were a la carte. Seats are similar to what is found on a regional jet - less width less legroom and they put 9 across on an A330-300. BUT the ticket price was $650 which was nearly $400 less than Air France. Flight was full difficult to sleep due to limited recline. Audio available in each seat. Video on overhead monitors - one movie offered. Boarding was odd no announcement so it was a free for all. Bottom line: I got to Paris with my luggage and paid only $650. The is a value airline but I have better things to do with $400 than give it to a legacy carrier.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,4.0,,3.0,,5.0,yes
23069,XL Airways France,5,XL Airways France customer review,19th May 2013,False,Flew XL Airways JFK-CDG last week. Its a low cost airline so you get what you pay for. Tickets are always really cheap but it has its toll. The plane was a brand new A330 with 400 souls inside so be patient. The check-in was probably the slowest I have seen in my life. They have a strict 1 bag 20 kgs policy and they could even charge you extra if your suitcase is a bit big even if its empty so check terms and conditions before buying a ticket.. No IFE on board no drinks or snacks just a breakfast upon arrival. Small seats little leg room but for half the price than anyone else.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,2.0,,1.0,,4.0,yes
23070,XL Airways France,n,XL Airways France customer review,19th May 2013,False,JFK-CDG. There was no online check-in or assigned seating. My carryon was weighed - backpack containing my purse and newspaper which I had to remove so it would weigh under 5 kilos. Luggage was piled to the side of check-in which was a hint of what was to come. Boarding was a nightmare as it was first come first served and not seating by rows or sections. 2 cups of water and 1 meal later we arrive and promptly find 2 of our party's luggage missing. It appeared that over 50 other passengers where missing their luggage. It is now day 3 of no luggage and I have nothing good to say about this airline.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,,2.0,,1.0,no
23071,XL Airways France,7,XL Airways France customer review,19th May 2013,False,CDG-JFK. New aircraft. Dinner served a couple hours after take off. Plenty filling. Seats are similar to what is found on a regional jet - less width less legroom and they put 9 across on an A330-300. Paid $650 which is a bargain. Return flight was not full requested a row to myself which was granted. Video on overhead monitors - one movie and a couple shorts. Unlike JFK boarding was by row from Paris.

23072,XL Airways France,3,XL Airways France customer review,4th February 2013,False,"We flew XL France out of Paris. Searching their website was most unhelpful. Unlike Air Asia Tiger Air and Jetstar (all are low cost carriers in Asia) we found XL France website the least interactive with customers. Our attempts to communicate with XL France to purchase two seat upgrades met with a ""wall"". We had to get friends in Paris to talk to them. Otherwise food in Premium economy was good. What saved. The day was a stewardess who was very professional with her excellent service to all. Leaving today 2013 for Paris fm Cancun and am told by XL I can only purchase an upgrade at the airport. So it means leaving early to wait in queue. You wished XL France could be more customer friendly.",,,Premium Economy,,,4.0,3.0,4.0,,2.0,,4.0,no
23073,XL Airways France,8,XL Airways France customer review,9th August 2012,False,XL Airways France is a charter airline that has recently entered the US market. I flew SFO to CDG non-stop and paid $500 less per person than I would have on Air France. That's considerable savings! I read you get what you pay for - well I happen to have flown Air France also and they are no different than XL Airways France. The economy in XLF is very similar to Air France with the exception of IFE/ individual screens. You get two meals on a 10 hour flight - a warm meal after take off and a cold meal before landing. One my first leg I upgraded to Premium Economy for a measly $39. The only difference is a few extra inches of leg room (barely noticeable) and leather seats. You still don't get individual screens (only in Galaxie Class or First Class). Crew is extremely friendly and bilingual.,,,Premium Economy,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes
23074,XL Airways France,8,XL Airways France customer review,1st August 2012,False,I just come back from a trip to the west coast: CDG-SFO-CDG. For the first time I flew on XLAirways. The check-in was quite good. However the boarding was a little bit of a mess in Paris. There were mothers with babies who had not been even taken care of. During the flight the kindness of the crew was quite good and its efficiency too. Seats would have leant a bit more you could have thought you were in business class.,,,Premium Economy,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes
23075,XL Airways France,9,XL Airways France customer review,2nd July 2012,False,Flew SFO-CDG on 2 Jun 2012 and return CDG-SFO on 30 Jun. Good flights in both directions. Economy seats are standard Airbus seats in 3-3-3 configuration on A330. Meals are typical airline fare. No matter what airline you fly always best to get a good pre-flight meal if in economy. One must recognize that the meal is simply to help pass the time. Whatever deficiencies others express about XL Airways are made up by the personable flight crew and the great fare prices. Check in was very efficient in San Francisco; typically Gallic in Paris.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes
23076,XL Airways France,9,XL Airways France customer review,12th June 2012,False,Paris-San Francisco in GALAXIE Class. Friendly service good food decent amenity kit and I liked the films on the video player. The plane is older but comfortable enough and the service makes up for it. The price for Galaxie is comparable to premium economy - and their service is far better than Air France. XL Airways is a great alternative and I'm glad they are doing the Paris-SFO LAS and NYC route. Good value for money! They need to add a lounge for Galaxie and maybe think about a loyalty program. I will fly them again over AF any day.,,,Premium Economy,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes

23078,XL Airways France,6,XL Airways France customer review,1st August 2011,False,My son and I have flown twice on XL mainly because we are on a budget to get to Paris. The seats are tiny and often the crew forget to translate what is being said into English. The crew in the cabin are good considering the long flights. The meals are horrible I recommend eating in the airport prior to boarding. If you don't mind getting up and going to find the crew yes there is enough water I recommend you bring a big bottle. The first time we flew the toilets backed up the second time no problems. Movies were in French only on 1st flight that was fixed on the second flight. Overall you get what you pay for so I will fly them again.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes
23079,XL Airways France,1,XL Airways France customer review,10th July 2011,False,We booked 3 tickets from JFK in New York City to Paris France because they were a great value on an online booking service. We did not recognize the name of the airline and after booking we started to research comments of those who had used XL. Most all of the comments were bad and we assumed it would be a bad experience. Both flights were on time to the minute. The boarding was fast and easy on both ends JFK & CDG. The airline attendants were both friendly and helpful! The food was good and there was plenty we did not finish eating all of ours. There was enough water so don't worry about taking your own. We have to fly on a regular basis and would choose XL Airways France again. These were among the best flights we have ever had. The only down side was that the seats were small and we are small people so that might be an issue but our flight was only 7 hrs so it didn't bother us. Also we don't know French and most of the details on the Internet are in French. We were assigned our seats when we checked in but there was no problem with getting our seating together. Everyone seemed happy on our flight and I did not hear one complaint.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes
23080,XL Airways France,8,XL Airways France customer review,27th June 2011,False,I travelled on XL I was worried about my trip because there is very little information about XL. The trip was fine. We arrived at JFK 3 hrs early and were all seated together (4 of us). The plane is mostly all French. The seats were fine. The service was fine. Our return trip was the same. I would recommend the airline for those looking for a cheap flight.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes

23082,XL Airways France,6,XL Airways France customer review,28th June 2010,False,XL Airways France flies twice a week between Paris and Las Vegas. The flights are cheap - a bit over $1800 for Galaxie class $700 for economy both round-trip. Separate lines for Galaxie class made check-in a breeze boarding was quick in Las Vegas a mess in Paris. Seats in the small Galaxie class section 27 of them on A330 were about what one would expect on a domestic AA or UA flight. Meals were decent and beverages were available throughout the flights.

23083,Yakutia Airlines,5,"""did not know what to expect""",24th September 2018,True,"  Moscow to Sochi. Flying Yakutia Airlines for the first time, I did not know what to expect. I flew economy, which allows you one in-cabin piece of luggage up to 10 kg within size restrictions. Boarding the aircraft, the first thing I noticed was the 737-800's aisle was very narrow. The aircraft was showing wear. I noticed the seats had ashtrays! And the two-plug receptacles for headphones (however, no inflight entertainment was offered). How old was this aircraft? That said, there was more legroom than I expected, so it was not too uncomfortable. The seat only had an airline safety card -- no magazine and no air-sickness bags (They distributed air-sickness bags to people on landing approach.) The flight left a few minutes late. When airborne, a sandwich was served. Bland chicken and cheese. When I asked for some water after the beverage service had passed, the unfriendly flight attendant acted as if I had asked for the world. The flight was relatively uneventful until the end. Our approach to Sochi was during clear skies, yet the landing was rough ... right wheel first, the left, then a hard nose down. Passengers let out a gasp as we shuddered down the runway before the pilot smoothed out our landing. I wonder if because of the age of the aircraft that it was lacking the ""state of the art"" avionics that most aircraft have which make such landings rare nowadays. I fly relatively frequently and it has been a long time since I had such a landing. In the end, we made it safely. For a national/regional mid-to-small airline I would rank it as average.

23084,Yakutia Airlines,6,"""crew were nice and polite""",15th April 2016,False,"  The trip from Yakutsk to Vnukovo was pretty regular, with nothing interesting about it. I would have personally chosen Aeroflot, but Yakutia Airlines was a bit cheaper and the airport of arrival was closer to my destination. Aircraft itself lacks AC outlets for charging electronics (outlets are present on aeroflot ones, flying YKS-SVO), but the crew were nice and polite, safety instruction was made via overhead screens, which, for some reason, were unavailable during the whole duration of the trip (7hr). Basically, there were no any in-flight entertainment. Concerning food and beverages - these were pretty much the usual ones, with 2 courses of meal - one at about 1-2 h in-flight, consisting of the usual beef/chicken/fish with some garnishes, bread, jelly and butter and the last one at 2h before landing, consisting of fruits, a bun and some cookies.

23086,Yakutia Airlines,6,Yakutia Airlines customer review,13th August 2011,False,"I took the weekly Yakutia flight from Magadan to Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy. At $446 it was an expensive flight but saved a lot of money and time compared to the alternatives. The experience is probably best described as nostalgic. The safety cards proclaimed that our aircraft is fitted out with modern and reliable equipment but aside from new seat covers it appeared that their definition of modern extends back to 1974. Safety cards appeared to have been written for a different aircraft - lifejackets were not under the seats (they were stuffed into the seat pockets). Seat pitch was good at 31 inches cabin comfort was not great - no ventilation and the seats were very worn and uncomfortable but the flight was not full so there was room to spread out. The sole FA was efficient and helpful and a snack box was served no meal trays though the slice-you-in-two metal meal trays were absent here. The flight was generally smooth and departed and arrived on time. One final surprise was that on arrival passengers collected their own bags from the aircraft hold (handing over their ""Aeroflot Soviet Airlines"" claim check) before boarding the bus to a gate in the fence next to the terminal building.",,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes

A little concerned when we fronted the quaint little desk in Yangon to find it unattended but were assured that there are helpers at all Myanmar airports who take your bag to the desk and deal with it. The next 3 flights on Yangon were good. Planes were all prop aircraft seating about 70. I think we were on the same plane every time. Seats are not allocated which worried us at first but it was not an issue. The sticker to identify patrons in the departure lounge are a cute touch.

23090,Yangon Airways,7,Yangon Airways customer review,10th March 2009,False,RGN-MDL on ATR . We were a bit sceptical when our travel agency booked on Air Yangon because we couldn´t find much about this airline in Skytrax. The plane left twenty minutes earlier than in our tickets stated- so do reconfirm the day before ! No hassle with luggage and weight security checks -as in the whole country- very relaxed but efficient. Comfortable seating on this short trip little snack for those who are extremely hungry.

23091,Yemenia,6,Yemenia customer review,9th October 2011,False,Beirut to Sana'a on A330. Yemenia offers a First and Economy class no Business. Odd concept as the First class hardly lives up to expectations. Pre-take off juice offered (this is a dry airline) and a passable dinner with a choice of three dishes presented on a trolley. Limited IFE mostly in Arabic but not a problem for this 3 hrs flight. Took off and landed more or less on time and the ticket price was good. Usual scramble at Sanaa airport.,,,First Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes
23092,Yemenia,5,Yemenia customer review,11th August 2011,False,Sanah to Mumbai on A330. A full flight but the crew were efficient polite and with passable English. I had window seat 30A and the legroom was just fine. Food was good but a little dry. Inflight entertainment not very exciting some Arabic drama without subtitles.

During the flight we were given a drink and a sandwich which was nice because the flight is so short. The crew members were professional and spoke Arabic and English (not French). I suppose the seats are standard for this kind of plane Boeing 737 and I had ample leg room. Also the plane was not full so I could have 3 seats to myself.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes
23094,Yemenia,3,Yemenia customer review,13th June 2011,False,Addis Ababa to Sana'a on Yemenia proved a dubious experience. Taking off at five in the morning meant check-in at three. Night-time seems a busy time at Addis Ababa airport as it was quite crowded. Took forever to get to the counter. Onboard settled down for a nap but woken by attendants insisting on serving a snack for breakfast. Plane almost full and seats narrow very tight legroom if person in front reclined seat. Suddenly announced flight was stopping in Aden due to troubled situation in Sana'a. Very poor information on how passengers would be shipped to Sana'a. Crew seemed as puzzled as passengers. Paid a visit to restrooms just before landing - an ugly sight. Price was reasonable and only direct flight from Addis to Sana'a so no choice really. Eventually got to Sana'a on domestic flight after a night in Aden courtesy of the airline.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,no
23095,Yemenia,5,Yemenia customer review,4th June 2011,False,Aden-Dubai on A310. Check-in swift and airside in less than 30 mins. Flight overbooked caused delay as ground staff sorted out rebookings for disgruntled pax. Boarding was mildly confusing as some pax did not respect seat assignments. Crew did their best to sort it out and finally got my seat. Seat pitch tight for someone over 180cm limited seat recline - good enough for 2h 30min flight would have been worse for long-haul. Video on safety procedures was running during take-off. Light meal served after take-off. Good selection of juices though only one drink offered. Cabin fairly clean but hygiene of restrooms questionable. Rule on mobile phone use not enforced by crew and several pax out of their seats emptying overhead bins while taxiing to stand at Dubai - quite chaotic.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes
23096,Yemenia,5,Yemenia customer review,19th May 2011,False,Sana'a-Taiz B737-800 on domestic half-hour flight. Check-in the usual scramble to ward off people jumping the queue. Once through formalities bussed to aircraft and funnelled through rear door in spite of only one or two passengers in biz. Economy cabin was packed. Passengers seemed to have been given generous hand luggage allowances resulting in crammed overhead compartments and stuffed under-seats. Light refreshment cold drink served - nice touch given short duration. Cabin attendants professional though not too smiley.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes
23097,Yemenia,4,Yemenia customer review,30th April 2011,False,Addis Ababa to Sanaa. Flight leaves Addis early morning 0445 but requested to be at airport two hours before departure - making this 1h30min flight an all-nighter. Boarding called way too early leaving pax waiting almost an hour at gate before doors opened. Old A310 Economy seats 2x4x2 config had exit row so okay for space. In spite of hand luggage limits several pax carrying huge bundles cramming the overhead bins. Bit of commotion as some pax were not allocated desired seats - took a while to sort. Meal served but didn't eat as trying to catch some sleep. Lights left on throughout flight. Seats standard economy not too clean though and interior showed serious signs of wear.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes
23098,Yemenia,5,Yemenia customer review,25th April 2011,False,Sana'a-Paris on A330. On-time departure in spite of elaborate boarding procedures. All pax bussed to aircraft. Inflight fine choice of meal and range of non-alcoholic drinks. Cabin crew courteous with passable English. Economy cabin looked a real mess after meal service - not cleaned. Limited inflight entertainment.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes
23099,Yemenia,7,Yemenia customer review,14th February 2010,False,RUH-Sana'a return on time on both legs. RUH-SHH sector was run by the customary A319 which look tired and old. No IFE and food was inedible. SHH-RUH sector a newer A330 was used but still no IFE. Food on this sector was passable scrambled eggs and foul. On both sectors staff ensured that security procedures were adhered to which was reassuring.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes
23100,Yemenia,7,Yemenia customer review,17th July 2009,False,ADD-AMM via Sanaa. Overnight in Sanaa where Yemenia provide hotel and breakfast. Pleasant flight attendants and acceptable food. A good flight and a lot cheaper than competitors. I had to change this flight and put it forward by one week which was no problem and didn't cost anything to change.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4.0,yes
23101,Yemenia,4,Yemenia customer review,10th March 2009,False,Addis Ababa to Cairo via Sana'a. I was pleasantly surprised. The food was very good. The planes were relatively new and in good condition. And this flight was at least $250 cheaper than all other alternatives for this route with other airlines. My only concern was the fact that I bought the ticket online from Bravofly.co.uk and got a confirmation number with no other instructions. However when I showed up at the airport I was told that my tickets were cancelled because I didn't reconfirm the flight 72 hours in advance with a local office. I've never had to do this for a flight for which I had already paid. Good thing they had 2 seats still left on the flight and rebooked my friend and I without further issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
23102,Yemenia,4,Yemenia customer review,18th February 2009,False,The tickets were the cheapest available. The Sana'a airport is very old small and inadequate. They say the new airport should be ready soon. The in flight entertainment is not that great. I notice less delays so they must be doing something good. I like the e- ticketing system. The food was good. The plane interiors needs to be maintained. I noticed some footrests that need some attention. Overall for the money you pay it is a good airline.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
23103,Yemenia,2,Yemenia customer review,30th May 2008,False,The return tickets London to Bangladesh were cheap so I chose to try them out. Both the economy and First class seats are shabby. London-Yemen flight was less than half full on an Airbus 310. In flight entertainment was abysmal with the same film shown on both outward and inward flights. There is no personal in-flight entertainment system everyone shares the same overhead screen. Sana'a airport transit lounge lets the airline down. There were over 200 people in the lounge with only 3 filthy cubicles for men and none of them had a working flush or toilet paper and all of them were overflowing with excrement (I have photos). There was no soap either. The 5 hour transit wait was unpleasant. Sanaa to Bangladesh flight was full. The aircraft was infested with flies and it was hard to eat. Food isn't great but its ok for the price. There are no snacks even if you ask. No extra milk for tea either except the powder sachet that you get once with your main meal. Reconfirming the flights in Bangladesh was erratic. Local agent asked I present my passport and ticket in person and present a copy of my visa (I was told by UK travel agents I only needed to phone in order to reconfirm)! In the end I argued with him and sent him a copy of my ticket and passport by fax. Return journey from Bangladesh to Sana'a was the same on Flight IY0873 and the first class seat I was in (seat 2E) was very shabby and only slightly larger than economy but did have good legroom. The footrests were broken and there were flies buzzing around. Trasit at Sanaa to London was done in the bus and boarding cards handed out while the bus was moving to the transit lounge where more people got on. The official took all our passports and disappeared for a while. He then left all our passports with a fellow passenger and jumped off the bus. We had to frantically grab our passports because of the risk of theft. Sanaa to London flight had same food and flies and the stewardess explained that the flies were around because of the dates in Yemen. We requested she spray insecticide and she said she would try but it never happened. 20 minutes before landing at Heathrow she sprayed insecticide but that was because of UK rules. Verdict - Flight schedule was super crew dont go the extra mile. I will travel with them again if the fare is cheap and I am the only traveller otherwise I will give them a miss. Not recommended for families because of the really poor transit lounge and toilets.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
23104,Yemenia,1,Yemenia customer review,16th May 2008,False,I bought the ticket as it was the cheapest available the service was horrible. The planes are ok and sometime you will have plenty of space to rest. There is very little in flight entertainment system. The headset does not work for most of the seats. Sana'a international airport is the worst airport I have seen in my life. There is a big dirty waiting room for the transit passenger and no facility to buy food or even shop. Strangely enough you have to request the guards to let you in the duty free region and most of them don’t understand English. The airport staff are very rough. The connecting flights are not regular. So if you miss one you are stuck at Sana'a for 2/3 days. Onboard food choice is very limited and sometimes I was offered no choice. Though there were options in the menu the cabin crews were giving whatever they want to the passengers. You can save some money with this but at the end of the day may have to regret like me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
23105,Yemenia,2,Yemenia customer review,7th April 2008,False,Jeddah-Sanaa-Paris return. On the way back I had big problem when I arrived to Sanaa my flight from Sanaa to Jeddah was supposed to depart at 1 am - operations cancelled this flight without being advised and postponed it to 1 pm next day. This flight was then delayed on ground as well while all the passengers onboard waiting for a VIP. The whole journey took me more than 40 hours.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
23106,Yemenia,n,Yemenia customer review,29th January 2007,False,Cairo to Sanaa and back. The service was good. Round trip flight had good service and despite a few kids running in the aisles it was a peaceful flight. Though I was confident of Yemeni before I am a little shaken up of a Yemenia flight report from my husband and worry about his flight home.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
23107,Yemenia,n,Yemenia customer review,18th October 2006,False,London to Aden (direct flight). Everything was OK except flight went down to Sanaa not continuing to Aden. There was no information during flight concerning this. 35 passengers was left to Sanaa airport. Next plane to Aden was departing after 18 hours. Luckily Yemenia paid us taxi so we went last 350km with Peugeot 505 with driver + four people and luggages. I fly few times From ADE to SAA and back during my stay. Every flight had some problems. Return flight from Aden to Sanaa had to be confirmed twice before departure. From Sanaa to Frankfurt flight was OK. It seems that domestic flights are made with left hand but international flights are taken care better. Next time I went to Aden via Dubai DXB-ADE-DXB was with Yemenia with no big problem only some delays. On international flights cabin crew was also better than domestic flights.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
23108,Yemenia,n,Yemenia customer review,11th April 2006,False,I flew 2 international flights London - Sana'a and 2 internal flights to Socotra and I have to say that on every flight the crew were the friendliest I have encountered in the last 5 years. Suggesting where we sit for the best views making extra cups of tea etc. While the internal flights were completely full and the Yemenis carry enough hand luggage to fill the pane twice over the international flights were so empty everyone had a whole row of seats to themselves which sure makes a change.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
23109,Yemenia,n,Yemenia customer review,26th January 2006,False,I had a fully reconfirmed ticket from Sana'a to Socotra and back. In Sana'a I was told the flight is full (!!) and could I come back every day to see if there are any changes. I finally got a seat on the plane. In Hadibu (on the island of Socotra) I had my ticket reconfirmed by an agent a week prior to departure and he was told that my name had been cancelled. As I had to fly back to Europe the same day I was furious. After a lot of angry words there was suddenly a seat available for me. The flight from Sana'a to Socotra costs 300 euros - one can almost fly from Amsterdam to New York for this fare! On the plane we were told that they had run out of coffee and we received nothing to eat or drink from 7am in the morning until 11am when we reached Sana'a airport! Never in my life have I experienced such bad service and incompetence.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
23110,Yemenia,n,Yemenia customer review,29th November 2005,False,I fly Yemenia every six months on the route Riyadh-Sana'a (via Aden) and back to Riyadh. They have reasonably new clean aircraft with good legroom and the food is no better or worse than what you are served on short distance economy class journeys on other airlines. Punctuality has been good except once and Yemenis are generally welcoming people which also applies to my experience with Yemenia booking-office staff in Sana'a. However I agree that most airlines in this region offer lower standards of aircraft and service on typical expat flights to Asia and flights with large numbers of deportees from Saudi Arabia can be a mixed experience. Generally I am satisfied with Yemenia and will use them on future flights to Sana'a.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
23111,Yemenia,n,Yemenia customer review,9th January 2004,False,London - Sana'a to Jakarta and found the service bad. I chose for Yemenia because it was the cheapest rate. I never have been in a airline with such rude FA's especially the male attendants! IFE was below average seat was cramed not comfortable inflight catering was OK but the cabin interior was so dirty. I feel sorry for the pax who sit near the restrooms it smells so bad!,,,,,,,,,,,,,no

23114,Yemenia,n,Yemenia customer review,6th May 2003,False,My trip was from Paris to Sana'a as a tourist and I wish to applaud the Yemenia flight attendants' customer service throughout the long flight. It was a cherishable trip.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no

As I went on board the flight attendant was not pleasant. There was no in flight entertainment just a magazine. The food was not great, we got some sweet which I didn't like personally and a packet of peanuts with water. The flight attendants were very rude as when I asked for the washroom they said in an unpolite and rude way ""The Seat Belt Sign is on be seated"". I didn't notice the sign was on and I asked them. They could have at least said it in a nice way.  The good thing though was that they allow around 20 kg of baggage and a bit excess. I forgot to mention that when I got my boarding pass I gave my skyclub card and they didn't bother to look at it even and they didn't give my sky miles either. I couldn't argue as a huge line was building up and I had to move. One more thing if you are about six feet tall or a bit less than that don't fly with this airline the legroom is very less, I had to squzee my legs and fit it in.

I received very good service by Yeti Airlines at Pokhara and Kathmandu airport on 1st Dec 2018. Due to fog, my flight was delayed. I had a connecting flight to Delhi from Kathmandu to Delhi at 1445. The Staff at Pokhara Airport were very helpful to my request to advance my booking to an earlier flight and ensured my luggage was loaded in the cabin itself, so that I could get it first when I landed at Kathmandu. At Kathmandu, the staff unloaded my luggage and took me in the small van to the terminal, so I could leave the airport quickly. I would rate this as excellent service.

The jetstream is a turboprop engine aircraft and has seating capacity for 29 person in an 1x2 arrangement The flight was smooth. Yeti Airlines has the reputation of flying on time. Though it's safety record is not very encouraging but has been spotless and blemish free since it separated it's mountains region operations in the name of Tara air as it's subsidiary. Sky miles, their frequent flyer program is very popular and has many other benefits like discounts in hotels, than award tickets. The name Yeti also is an attraction to the visitors.

23125,ZIPAIR,8,"""I’d highly recommend ZIPAIR""",14th June 2023,False,"  A small bottle of water is $2. Cup of coffee $4. It is certainly easy enough to bring snacks/food from home, or pick something up from the airport, just be forewarned.  You will pay $50-$80 for any checked bags, up to three. They did not check the weight of my carry-on on the way to Japan, but did for the return flight. And as one of my checked bags was overweight, I had to re-distribute from on to another there at the check-in counter, but that was fine and the agent helped me so I didn’t have to pay for an additional suitcase. The seat was very comfortable, but you’re only able to partially recline it. There is no video screen, no in-flight entertainment, and the only Wi-Fi we were able to access went directly to their service site where you could order food and drinks. This is no frills but the airfare was $800 less than any other carrier. So even with a connecting flight on Southwest, and staying overnight in a hotel near the airport in San Jose (Hyatt Place, highly recommended) I still came out $500 under any other fare. The days when “getting there is half the fun” are long gone.

Any mistakes you make during booking, they won’t able to change and require cancellation of booking. When that happen, they only partially refund your money. If you don’t check-in within 1 hour of departure at the counter you won’t able to fly.  The plane are small and they charge you on every single things including a plastic cup. And they picky about your carry-on weight. Overall, you think you save money by going cheap then its actually the opposite. You will spend a lot more money if you are late to the check-in. Or if you mess up the flight date. This is based on my experienced. Because those events above mention did happen to me. I was 5 mins late to check-in even when the plane departure is in 1 hour.

When I first arrived to the gate, no one was at the ticket counter so I thought it’d be fine to sit inside. However a few minutes later the attendants returned and told me I had to wait outside to check my boarding pass, so I did. Then they started letting people sit at the gate after checking their boarding pass so I went and sat inside the gate while waiting for my flight. However, an hour before my schedule flight, the attendants came by again to kick out all the passengers from the gate because of “security reasons” so everyone had to wait outside the gate while the attendants boarded the plane. When the attendant came to kick me out, she told me politely to leave so I was packing my things but she clicked her tongue at me as I left. The price is cheap, but I found Hawaiian Airlines to be cheaper than ZipAir and never have been treated like this at any airline before, hence the poor review. Staff definitely needs more training since they assumed I couldn’t speak Japanese and kept muttering things under their breath like “tsk we can’t avoid (scary looking) passengers like that” or “(it’s annoying that) we have to keep repeating the same things” etc. These are just a few things I heard and I don’t think I’ll ever fly with Zipair again.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hawaii to Japan,May 2023,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,3.0,no

It wasn't separated well and was very confusing. The C26 counter was said for Bangkok check-in, so I queued in the row for about 15 minutes aiming for it. But then, the C25 Singapore counter was free and called me out. I refused her because I was waiting for the C26 counter. She didn't understand and asked me why I queued in this row, so I told her counter C26 was said for Bangkok. She didn't believe me that C26 is for Bangkok and walked out from the counter. She realized her mistake when she saw the sign above the counter and the C26 staff told her that her counter was really for Bangkok. Although she realized it, she still didn't say any apologies to me and still asked me to queue again from the start in another row which I was frustrated.

23135,ZIPAIR,9,"""thoroughly content with my experience""",28th April 2023,True," First off, I’m not a picky flyer by any means. I only get up from my seat to stretch occasionally and always bring my own entertainment options, no matter what is offered in-flight. I don’t need a lot of space or amenities to be content, even though I’m not a small guy. That was the initial attraction to ZIPAIR for me, not paying for things I wasn’t going to use. Entertainment? Bring your own (every seat has a USB-A charging port and they allow power banks, so don’t sweat the electrons). Meals, snacks, and drinks? Offered, but must be paid for separately either before you board, or in-flight via a browser interface using the plane’s WiFi system. Honestly, fine with me. I brought my own snacks and water on board, and used WiFi to order some drinks. The flights were incredibly smooth, the cabin staff were a vision of professionalism and care, the planes were spotless, and the seat comfort was better than expected despite being in Economy. For that matter, buying the tickets through the simple website was a breeze, check-in at the airports took less than 5 minutes, and because I kept my baggage simple, the tickets were vastly less expensive than other options. My only gripes were cabin temperatures - for some reason the cabin felt just a bit stifling both to and fro, and the air vents were on the anemic side - and the WiFi was a bit spotty. Honestly, these are relatively minor complaints (especially WiFi, hardly a necessity), and I feel these in no way diminished the value of what I saved on my fare. To sum up: I kept my expectations simple, and was thoroughly content with my experience flying with ZIPAIR.

These seats are marketed as Business Class 'Lite' i.e.. you are getting a flat bed seat but not much else for the ticket price. However, I would actually rate the experience with Zip on this flight from Tokyo to Singapore more highly than my experiences with other airlines such as British Airways, who constantly disappoint. The value for money is way better that's for sure. As is the customer service. In summary: Check in process could have been better. Had to wait in queue for about half an hour. I think all passengers are required to manually check in at a desk for this flight. Or at least we were on this occasion. No fast track for business class. On the flight itself, the seats were very comfortable. The blanket provided was especially nice. As were the slippers. The restrooms were very clean and the toiletries provided were ample. Things like mouthwash, hand cream, etc. The staff were excellent. Polite, attentive, courteous. The food was good for what it was. I had spicy chicken with rice. It was basically a microwave meal but still tasty. The fruit was fresh and flavoursome. Free Wi-Fi for business class. Although this is a given on most premium seats, there are still airlines who cash in on charging for Wi-Fi (British Airways for example), so its nice that Zip provide it for free.

If you are not automatically checked in by the airline, don’t bother trying to use these machines. We were sent on a run around by their ground staff and by the time they tried to ‘help’ us self checkin, there was a huge line for the counter. Fortunately we got to the airport early. The ZIPAIR staff seem clueless & kept asking folk to use the self check in. Not typical Japanese efficiency. I guess you get what you pay for.

They also made us take out 3kg and put in our hand luggage because of some random policy. They then make you wait for 5-10 minutes while they check your bag for some unknown reason.

Once we booked we noticed the website was hard to navigate, the app we were supposed to download preflight isn't available in the US yet and there weren't many reviews. We Googled Zipair to make sure it was a real airline. The moment we checked in we realized this airline is real and it's an amazing deal. The customer service reps at check in asked if we'd been to Japan before and what we were excited about doing while quickly and efficiently checking us in. It was a great start but were concerned about seat comfort and inflight Wifi. As we entered the plane we realized seat comfort was not an issue. The seats were a clean, comfortable leather and had more leg space than most American carriers. Once we got in the air the Wifi connected quickly so we could access email and order food. It's not strong enough to download movies or tv shows so do that before you board. Food options are limited, they run out quick if you don't preorder. I suggest eat early or bring your own food. Beverages were comparably priced with other airlines and it didn't seem to run out of any drinks. The inflight staff was very attentive and kept trash out of the aisles and seat backs the entire flight. Our return trip from Tokyo to San Francisco was exactly the same. Friendly staff during check in, comfortable seats, quick WiFi for ordering food and checking email and very attentive flight attendants.

The food we pre-ordered was pretty good for airline food. The only negative is that the cabin crew never came by to check on whether we needed anything. Not a big deal. We think that Zipair is a very decent airline and hope we have the chance to fly again soon. My wife loved the business class seats.

I was in a huge bind because I had missed my original return flight and re-booking with Singapore airlines cost several thousand dollars + an additional fee of 300 dollars. Luckily I was able to book through ZIPAIR last minute and got a flight from NRT -> SJC directly for roughly 424 dollars. This saved me a lot of time and trouble and I had no problems with the airlines. It would be nice if they had a few more amenities or food but a roughly 10 hour direct flight which was offered last minute. Cannot complain and would recommend this airline.

So that meant that even if I didn't hit the limit of 32kg extra baggage that I purchased out of my own pocket using 1 bag, the other bags cannot be checked in. Judging from the number of people who were also stuck at the check-in line, I know that this requirement is not clearly made known to passengers. Had to purchase for seat assignments.

Off to a good start, the check-in was fast and efficient. I flew in Standard (economy) class with 3-3-3 seating, which was comfortable with adequate legroom. The basic fare is only for the seat, but I opted for the ""value"" package to get 23 kg checked baggage, seat selection plus a meal (pre-selected from a picture menu) and still saved about $500 over the fares of established airlines. Passengers are required to show their boarding pass during flight to verify the optional upgrade. The tasty meal came in a box on a tray, with just beef and rice next to bottled water. There was no salad, dessert nor other drink, But the free Wi-Fi connected to my smart phone allowed ordering drinks and snacks later, as well as compensating for having no seatback screen. The charming cabin attendants were very safety conscious, double-checking to make sure overhead bins were closed securely. ZipAir should be commended for creating a unique budget flying experience on lengthy international flights. Some earlier negative Skytrax reviews were based on unmet pandemic regulations and refund policies, not the flights themselves, Overall, I highly recommend ZipAir as an alternative to traditional carriers whose fares have skyrocketed on the HNL-NRT route since the pandemic, Just follow the their common sense rules and enjoy the money saved.",Boeing 787,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Honolulu to Tokyo Narita,November 2022,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,yes

They said my poster tube exceeded the dimensions of their overhead compartment. They insist that I paid for another 23kg of check-in luggage when my check-in luggage was 19.5kg of 23kg and my hand carry was only 4.5kg of 7kg. It was very clear that they did not want to listen to my explanation that my luggage was under weight and the poster tube weighed under 2kg. They kept saying that it is company policy. The flight was less than 20% occupied. A Very empty flight. The overhead compartment would have easily contained my poster tube with plenty of space to spare. Poster paper measures 27inch width and 39inch height rolled into a poster tube (cardboard) 2 inches longer than the poster's width.  The cabin crew were unsmiling patrolling the aisles like the police. I found them annoying as they made their presence felt, too much and gave out that I am watching you feeling. And it's not like they were giving out water. You have to pay for it. My pre-paid inflight meal was not bad. The expensive wagyu beef bowl is available and they seemed to have stopped selling their normal beef bowl.(minus points here) Purchased a can of Suntory Premium Beer and Pringles. Paid with a credit card but had to type in my details on their tablet. Prices were reasonable but I had to self-type all the cc details, etc for it to happen. Cash is not accepted for inflight sales. Otherwise, the flight was smooth., cabin was clean (hardly any pax) Less rigidity and friendly cabin crew may improve business.

But inside the airplane there was not only plenty of space but I’ve flown with the same suitcase carry-on for years. So they had me pay a fee to take the luggage to checked baggage. I asked them if they can make it cheaper if I take stuff out. I had 15kg. They said no, 6500 yen is the cheapest. Then I looked on the website and the cheapest was under 14kg with 5500 yen. I came to the airport 3h before departure and waited and waited at the gate. I saw then boarding two other destinations (Singapore and Bangkok) before they started with Los Angeles (my destination). I went there one hour before departure because I was worried. They said that the gates are closed and we can’t het checked in, I said I was there for 3h and not once did I hear them call the LAX flight.  They eventually let all of us in and we managed to get on the plane.  I just wanted the minimum amount of respect and professionalism when dealing with customers. If one of them complains, it’s maybe the customer who’s crazy.

23169,ZIPAIR,6,"""It was immaculately clean""",23rd May 2022,True," Zipair is JAL’s budget airline. They don’t have classes of travel, you just pick your seat (flat bed, emergency exit etc) and pay accordingly. We usually travel BA or JAL business class. This trip was last minute and JAL business was going to cost $8k. Instead we paid just over $2.5k to fly with Zipair in their fully flat seats. Your ticket includes nothing but 7kg of cabin baggage (and they do weigh rucksacks/handbags etc), a bottle of water and the seat you booked. Check in process was not good. Of course we aren’t used to queuing for check in, but here everyone queues. There is no Advanced Passenger Information loaded, so with covid added the check in process was long. Also both our cabin bags were over 7kg so we had to put a bag in the hold. (You can pay to add a bag to the hold, but you can’t pay for additional cabin baggage. They are strict on weight to the gram). We were also asked if we had a return ticket, which as it was booked at the same time as the outward trip was a bit worrying. Finally because the seat map is misleading we had not booked seats together (eg row 2 does not align across the cabin so although we had seats that were both in row 2, in fact I was sat behind and to the right of my husband. This was pointed out to us at check-in but we weren’t allowed to change our seats despite the fact that there were only 2 other seats taken in the fully flat cabin. Seats must be booked at least 24 hours before check-in and again this is enforced strictly. (We couldn’t even change seats on board although the seat on my husband’s left was free). The fully flat bed was nearly as good as JAL/BA business class (not quite so much storage). Includes reading light, table and some storage space. You can stow your hand baggage under the foot stool for take-off and landing (an improvement on the new BA business class seats). Its quite hard, but otherwise good. It was immaculately clean (again better than BA), cabin crew were excellent and it felt safe. There is no entertainment screen. WiFi is included free of charge, and a (very) small selection of films is available. The fully flat seat has a USB charging point. Fairly basic food and drinks can be bought on board by ordering via your mobile device and QI code. The onboard shop opens about an hour after take-off and closes about an hour before landing. Otherwise meals must be booked in advance. Pre-booked meals are served before the onboard shop is open, so you can’t buy a drink until after your meal. Cushions and blankets are not included, but can be bought from the online shop. In deciding whether to use Zipair you need to compare cost to convenience. If you have time to download movies, book seats in advance (there is no app to make this easy), pre-order meals, and to bring your own pre- and with-meal drinks that will help. Also to bring your own cushion/blanket if you like to sleep as soon as you get on board. For me, some of the joy was missing. There wasn’t enough meal/entertainment/shopping to pass much time for those who are not good at sleeping. Is that worth $5.5k - only you can answer that.",Dreamliner,Business,Business Class,Tokyo to Los Angeles,May 2022,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,yes

They have no agreements with any connecting airlines to transfer you once in Narita, hence they denied boarding and did not offer a refund. Nor did they advise of such at purchase. Lost $1000 with this airline.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Tokyo,May 2022,,,,1.0,,,1.0,no
